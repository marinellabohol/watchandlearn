# watchandlearn

Project for CS 160, partnered with Christian Cayabyab, Helen Lee, Shirley Li, & Sanket Padmanabhan

Created a web-based language learning application that uses machine learning to teach and assess vocabulary, in a final group project. The objective was to identify a user problem through various needfinding skills, and iterate through numerous cycles of user evaluation, refinement, and implementation of a final solution.
