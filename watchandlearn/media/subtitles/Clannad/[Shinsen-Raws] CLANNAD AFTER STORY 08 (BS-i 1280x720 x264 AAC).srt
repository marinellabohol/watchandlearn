2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,030
Not getting enough sleep?

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,200
Pardon me. I wasn't able to sleep very well last night.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,450
Is there no charm for sleeping well?

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,010
There is, but...

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,120
Charm for getting good sleep.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,750
Have someone give you a lap pillow.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,850
With this, a peaceful slumber is...

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,840
...all yours.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,470
This is not a charm.

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,030
But it does sound like you could get a good sleep.

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,810
I had my brother do it for me often when I was little,

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,030
but now that I'm older...

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,860
I have an idea!

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,820
How about having Tomoya-kun give you the lap pillow in place of your brother?

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,090
I shouldn't. I would feel bad for you.

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,790
Please don't worry. Go ahead.

18
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,870
I'm sorry. Then I'll accept
your offer and borrow him for a bit.

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,180
Excuse me.

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,180
Y-Yeah...

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,070
It feels... good...

22
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,870
She fell asleep in no time.

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,620
You don't feel anything looking at this?

24
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,240
To be honest, I am a little jealous.

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,210
But when I see that look on her...

26
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,710
She must have been tired.

27
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,730
She must always be stressed over the fights Sudou-san and her friends get in.

28
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,760
Yo ho! Is Yukine-chan here?!

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,720
Let me have your delicious pilaf again!

30
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,100
Making yourselves at home!

31
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,030
Oww...

32
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,730
Hush please.

33
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,310
What? Oh!

34
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,420
Kazuto Nii-san...

35
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,550
I'm sorry. I completely fell asleep.

36
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,380
No, I didn't mind.

37
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,800
I'll lend you my lap next time.

38
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,120
Why are you here?

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,900
I want to meet Yukine Onee-chan, too.

40
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,820
Yuki-nee!

41
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,190
Sudou-san!

42
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,820
They all think Sunohara-san is my brother?

43
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,500
Yeah. They think Kazuto-san got out of the hospital.

44
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,330
They're all scared.

45
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,160
They're afraid they have no chance of winning now that Miyazawa Kazuto's back on the streets.

46
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,930
That's why they've panicked and have snuck over to our side.

47
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,960
This was never supposed to happen.

48
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,420
But that's all a misunderstanding.

49
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,730
Yeah! It was Tomoyo that beat them up them yesterday and-

50
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,730
Miyazawa.

51
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,480
Regarding what happened yesterday...

52
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,320
Crap! I'll see you again, Yuki-nee!

53
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,110
Sudou-san!

54
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,170
Looks like I came at the perfect time.

55
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,630
So you guys got caught in another mess?

56
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,920
We didn't choose to be in it.

57
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,000
It's all because you pretended to be Miyazawa Kazuto-san.

58
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,390
I am familiar with the name Miyazawa Kazuto.

59
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,620
I've heard a rumor back when I was still fighting gangs.

60
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,320
It said Miyazawa Kazuto would be the only person who could fight me face to face.

61
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,280
Face to face against you?!

62
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,820
I've heard many of your great stories, too, Sakagami-san.

63
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,280
I won't bring this matter up in school this time.

64
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,120
But...

65
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,630
But?

66
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,370
The other day, I had a chance to talk to
a member of another school's Student Council.

67
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,900
There have been many fights in this city recently.

68
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,140
At this rate, we will see the police become involved, sooner or later.

69
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,640
Here's my advice.

70
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,610
Stop being fools and be friends.

71
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,940
Otherwise you'll all suffer.

72
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,570
Those bastards! I'll kill them all!

73
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,110
Let's go raid their place right now!

74
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,870
Yeah! Let's do it!

75
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,150
We'll show them what we've got!

76
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,270
Let's do it!

77
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,170
Miyazawa. When will
your brother be discharged?

78
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,160
Kazuto-san can stop the fight, right?

79
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,580
Where are you going, Onee-chan?

80
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,520
I'll go talk to them!

81
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,090
Miyazawa-san!

82
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,890
You guys stay here.

83
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,730
Hold up, Miyazawa!

84
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,090
Think about it. It's not like you can solve anything even if you go.

85
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:20,910
I'm familiar to them, and I know where they hang out often, too.

86
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,070
Your brother doesn't know what's going on?

87
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,840
Even if he's in the hospital, can't he convince Sudou and the others over the phone?

88
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,360
I understand the story.

89
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,810
So at this rate, both sides will be broken up, eh?

90
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,860
Yes. If the fight escalates,
the police may become involved.

91
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,220
How do you expect us to back out now?!

92
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,500
Since Miyazawa Kazuto's back on the streets, we have to take you guys down before we're done!

93
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,070
Like I said, that was a misunderstanding.

94
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,720
How so?!

95
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,000
Last night, we got our asses kicked by your brother.

96
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,780
That was Sakagami Tomo-

97
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,210
Yukine-san. We've got nothing against you, but we can't listen to you on this one.

98
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,640
We've got injured people on this side, too!

99
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,330
We can't stop now!

100
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,550
Stop it you guys.

101
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,920
This is war!

102
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,300
We have to continue until one of us is crushed!

103
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,440
Yeah! This is a fight to the death!

104
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,940
Yeah! Yeah!

105
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,980
I said shut the hell up!

106
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,540
You're all being rude to our guests.

107
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,490
Yukine-san. You've treated my wounds before, too.

108
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,960
I haven't forgotten the care and
the taste of the pilaf from that day.

109
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,410
It's been a month, and he hasn't taken off the bandage yet.

110
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,630
Yeah, Sasaki-san likes girls who are good cooks.

111
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,090
Did you say something?

112
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,260
No, nothing!

113
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,890
But as you see, we can't let things end like this.

114
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,890
So, how does a one-on-one between the leaders sound?

115
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
One-on-one?

116
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,730
Your brother and I will fight one-on-one.

117
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,280
Whoever loses will submit to the winner.

118
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,940
That's the limit to the compromise we can make.

119
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,250
And you agreed to that?!

120
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,560
Yuki-nee, how could you do that without talking to us?!

121
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,860
I'm sorry. That was the only choice I had in the situation.

122
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,670
The time is tomorrow evening, at the river bank.

123
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,050
But Kazuto-san can't fight.

124
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,230
We have to send a substitute.

125
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,090
But will they agree to that?

126
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:52,900
Hey. They think Sunohara-san's Miyazawa Kazuto-san, right?

127
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,340
That's right!!!

128
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,530
You're joking!

129
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,110
Please wait! Sunohara-san has nothing to do with us...

130
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:06,740
You were bragging yesterday that it was you who busted up four guys at once.

131
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,540
Four at once?!

132
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,350
That's amazing.

133
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,500
You'll totally do as Kazuto-san's substitute.

134
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,510
You often say "Don't judge a book by its cover", but wow, you're amazing.

135
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,720
I-It's nothing.

136
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,200
Sunohara Aniki! Please lend us your strength!

137
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,090
Can I get another glass of this first?

138
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,900
Sunohara-san. Will you really be doing a one-on-one fight?

139
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,090
I don't think fighting is good.

140
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,900
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,320
They aren't that bad of people, either.

142
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:58,090
But when there are two groups
in a small city, they can't help but clash.

143
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:07,150
Unless everyone in the city is happy,
no one is truly happy.

144
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,700
They're all nice people individually,

145
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,260
yet, why does this happen?

146
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,370
Man, this is pretty nerve-wracking.

147
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,700
Hey! Are you still going to make us wait?!

148
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,330
Wait until Sasaki-san comes!

149
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,520
God, it feels like my heart's going to burst.

150
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,090
Sunohara-san. How about filling your stomach while you have the chance?

151
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,380
This is a little something from my mom.

152
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,010
From Sanae-san?!

153
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,390
I said Sunohara-san would be having a very important fight, and so she made me bring this.

154
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,100
Her newest creation. Hyper Rainbow Bread.

155
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,960
Wow!

156
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,120
And a message from Dad, too.

157
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,790
He said, "Rainbow to you".

158
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,620
And here's an ultimate jam made by her friend.

159
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,820
If you put this ultimate jam on Mom's bread,

160
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,910
you've got yourself the ultimate combination.

161
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,000
Would you all like to try some?

162
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,710
We can?

163
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,300
Thanks.

164
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,880
Itadakimasu!

165
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,050
What's wrong, everyone?

166
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,510
Please get a hold of yourself.

167
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,660
Sorry for the wait.

168
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,520
Crap!

169
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,440
What do we do? Everyone's out cold.

170
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,940
I'll go.

171
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,910
Tomoya-kun!

172
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,940
Are you serious?

173
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,640
We don't have time to argue. Take care of everyone.

174
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,040
Okazaki-san!

175
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,790
What's the meaning of this?

176
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,180
There has been a little misunderstanding.

177
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,780
He's actually not Miyazawa Kazuto.

178
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,050
Sorry, but you'll have to do with me.

179
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,640
It's no good. We need
the real Miyazawa Kazuto-san.

180
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,040
Your brother won't come no matter what?

181
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,480
To either fight Sasaki-san or stop the fight, we need Miyazawa-san's brother.

182
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,280
Fine. I'll play with you a bit.

183
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,400
Thanks a bunch!

184
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,070
Go, Aniki!

185
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,270
Get him!

186
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,980
Tomoya-kun!

187
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,370
Onii-chan, go!

188
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,930
Do you have a bad right shoulder?

189
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,200
A little.

190
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,760
But I don't need you to hold back!

191
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,080
You don't have to tell me!

192
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
You're one tough guy.

193
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,960
Enough. Stay down.

194
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,520
Looks like your guys are up.

195
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,770
Sunohara-san.

196
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,470
Are you all okay?

197
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,330
Okazaki!

198
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,220
Okazaki, what happened?!

199
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,530
Sunohara-san!

200
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,920
What did you do to Yuki-nee's bud?!

201
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,130
Everyone, follow them!

202
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,890
Stop it, Sunohara!

203
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,850
Sasaki-san's in danger!

204
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,680
Don't fall behind!

205
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,140
Stop! Don't come!

206
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,810
Wait! Stop! Stop!

207
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,860
K-Kazuto-san!

208
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,640
It's him.

209
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,740
What's going on?

210
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,620
So that's the real Miyazawa Kazuto?

211
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,800
He snuck out of the hospital, eh?

212
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,250
As the rumors say,
you've got balls, Miyazawa Kazuto!

213
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,090
But I can't go easy on you.
Sorry, but I have to beat you up!

214
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:42,890
Miyazawa?!

215
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,720
I'm not done yet!

216
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,580
Stop it. What are you thinking?

217
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,420
I'm...

218
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,990
I'm Miyazawa Kazuto!

219
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,240
Stop it, Miyazawa!

220
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,290
Let go! Let go!

221
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,170
When did she...

222
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,270
She went running, saying she'd go get her brother.

223
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,290
I thought she went to the hospital...

224
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,410
There's no way she can go get him...

225
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,880
There's no way she can go get Kazuto-san!!!

226
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,380
Let go!!!

227
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,880
Don't get in my way!

228
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,500
Yuki-nee, it's enough!

229
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,270
Yuki-nee!

230
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,770
Why is she doing this?

231
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,570
You dumbass!

232
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,590
To stop you guys, of course!

233
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:43,760
The only way to stop the fight is for Miyazawa Kazuto to come out!

234
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,060
That's why she pretended to be her brother!

235
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,870
Don't you get it?!

236
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,830
Why... Why do we have to fight?

237
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,130
What does it take to not fight?!

238
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,510
What does it... What does it take...

239
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,450
Please. Please stop fighting.

240
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,420
I'm sure my brother wishes for that, too.

241
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,330
So that was the reason.

242
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,620
For the longest time, I was afraid of my brother and his friends.

243
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:48,800
But seeing Sudou-san and Tajima-san cry at his funeral, I wondered...

244
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,190
"Why didn't I try to understand his way of life more?"

245
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,750
That's why I mustered up some courage to get to know everyone.

246
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,880
At first, it was scary,

247
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,790
but little by little, you all let me into the group.

248
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:17,510
And being with you all made me feel like I was laughing with Kazuto Nii-san.

249
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,250
My brother wished there were no fights until the very end.

250
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,700
But if the truth of him missing were to be revealed,

251
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,310
we thought Sasaki-san's group would come against us.

252
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,940
That's why we talked matters over and
decided to keep my brother's death a secret.

253
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,940
It was my brother's wish to be rid of fights from this city.

254
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,570
I wanted to realize that...

255
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,310
...no matter what!

256
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,890
I'm sure Kazuto Nii-san's happy right now.

257
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,990
Is something wrong, Tomoya-kun?

258
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,050
I feel at peace now.

259
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,680
It could be that I've finally accepted what happened to my brother.

260
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,560
I owe it to all of you. Thank you very much.

261
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,230
Are you all familiar with this city's legend?

262
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,400
Legend?

263
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,970
The moment something good happens or a moment of happiness is experienced,

264
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,310
an orb of light appears.

265
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,890
No one knows what they are.

266
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,520
What is for certain is those lights are taken as symbols of happiness.

267
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,040
And if you obtain one,
any one wish can be granted.

268
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,530
Tomoya-kun. Isn't this Misae-san's story?

269
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,600
Yeah.

270
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,000
But it looks like less and less people see them now.

271
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,040
So the light Okazaki says he saw is that?

272
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,870
Maybe Okazaki-san is special.

273
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,750
Me?

274
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,360
What do you mean?

275
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,610
I'm sorry. I'm not sure of anything more.

276
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,770
But Okazaki-san, you're still you.

277
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,930
My important friend.

278
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,310
You're all my important friends.

279
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm really a blessed person.

280
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,090
I'm supported by so many people.

281
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,440
Kazuto Nii-san...

282
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,630
Thank you.

283
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,360
What will you do once you graduate?

284
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,500
You've got a really gloomy face so early in the morning.

285
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,370
Did you have a fight with Nagisa-chan?

286
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,620
Something similar happened before, too, didn't it?

287
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,090
I mean, at crucial times, you're...

288
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,250
I hope he got distracted a little.

289
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,530
Puhi?

290
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,230
Puhi..

291
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,220
Tomoya-kun isn't happy.
