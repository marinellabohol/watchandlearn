2
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,580
Watch out, Tomoya-kun!

3
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,560
Are you all right, Tomoya-kun?

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,680
Yeah. I spaced out there for a second.

5
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,640
Don't be looking up at the sky!

6
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,190
We're sorry!

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,100
It's not my fault if you get hurt!

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,250
Dad's at bat.

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,060
I want you to cheer him on, too.

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,600
Akio-san, fight!

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,310
This home run is...

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,610
Sanae!

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,510
This one's for you!

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,060
He did it!

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,490
You're amazing, Dad!

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,960
You see that?!

17
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,970
Hey. We're gonna play baseball.

18
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,810
Go ahead.

19
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,280
Don't give me that!

20
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,020
There's another game next Sunday,
so I'm telling you to go get a team together.

21
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,020
You never did.

22
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,480
We're up against the neighboring shopping district team.

23
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,320
They're the rival of our shopping district team.

24
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,490
Dad's part of the adult team, too.

25
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,540
But they've recently recruited a former
high school national tournament player.

26
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,980
Thanks to that, we're on a losing streak against them.

27
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,540
We're pathetic.

28
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,750
So that's why the neighbors didn't look as cheerful as they normally are.

29
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,630
To liven up our town, we've got to win the next match no matter what.

30
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,900
I don't care if the entire team's made up of helpers.

31
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,370
What's most important is to reverse this course.

32
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,930
So why do I have be a part of this?

33
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,070
Nagisa, could you pass me the soy sauce?

34
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,810
Second semester starts for you guys today.

35
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,630
You've got your buddies in the school theater club.

36
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,460
Sure.

37
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,050
From the moment I saw the teamwork
you guys showed at the School Festival,

38
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,860
I've been wanting to play baseball with you guys.

39
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,690
If you're Nagisa's boyfriend,
then be nice to the daddy, too.

40
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,200
Hey! You know my right shoulder's injured!

41
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,830
You lit the fire in my heart!

42
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,130
Like the fireball!

43
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,000
That made no sense.

44
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,010
We might be able to make a miracle.

45
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,310
The second semester has started.

46
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,260
I'm still living at Nagisa's place.

47
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,270
As a senior in high school, we should be starting to decide our futures.

48
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,540
But I still don't have a clue about my future.

49
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,740
I'm in!

50
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,700
It sounds fun!

51
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,060
Having Kyou-chan on the team will make us invincible.

52
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,450
To draft this Sunohara Youhei...
Nagisa-chan's father knows how to pick 'em.

53
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,010
Yeah. He has high hopes for
your prodigy-like athleticism.

54
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,080
I see. So talent seems to pour out even if you're trying to hide it.

55
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,970
He's as easy to manipulate as usual.

56
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,840
What did you just say?!

57
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,940
I was just joking with you!

58
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,850
Note: Okazaki is making a reference to the commercial tag line for menstrual pads

59
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,850
You're a super prodigy and super athletic,
and super-slim so super-safe at night, too.

60
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,060
Damn right I am!

61
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,550
Tomoya-kun. I want to try playing baseball, too.

62
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,830
Do you know the rules, Kotomi?

63
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,470
I watched you and Tomoyo-chan having a match against the Baseball Team.

64
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,580
It looked like lots of fun.

65
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,570
You were watching that?

66
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,900
What about you, Ryou?

67
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,580
I-I'll cheer from the side. I don't have confidence in sports.

68
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,380
I'll do my best at cheering, too.

69
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,670
Good luck, Tomoya-kun.

70
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,790
What?

71
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,340
You guys are looking more and more like a couple now.

72
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,510
You think so?

73
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,800
What do you want,
calling me to a place like this?

74
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,720
Sunohara wants to do
something perverted to you.

75
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,440
I guess there wasn't a need to test Tomoyo's athleticism.

76
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,180
Am I a measurement tool?!

77
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,440
What is this about?

78
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,450
It's amazing that even Tomoyo-san's joining.

79
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,810
I haven't decided to, yet.

80
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,910
I said I would if Misae-san would, too.

81
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,180
Misae-san looks like she has good athleticism, so we've got to talk her into it.

82
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,950
I've known her for a long time, so it'll work if I ask her to join.

83
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,960
It's Yoshino Yuusuke-san.

84
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,840
Ah, from the wedding some time ago.

85
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,560
Perfect. Let's invite him, too.

86
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,300
Hey, Yoshino-san!

87
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,940
It looks like he didn't hear you.

88
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,790
Let's start a Yoshino call.

89
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,090
Yoshino call?

90
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,140
Like an anchor at concerts.

91
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,820
Then I bet he'll remember the days he was a musician and answer us.

92
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,900
Ready?

93
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:39,540
YOSHINO! YOSHINO! YOSHINO!

94
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,070
Louder!

95
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,860
What kind of harassment is this?!

96
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,920
I can't. I have work on Sunday.

97
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,010
I see...

98
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,190
It's nothing personal. See you.

99
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,010
Wait!

100
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,510
Tomoya-kun. I don't think you should push it.

101
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,010
He... Sunohara looks up to you.

102
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,600
His house is up north, so when he graduates,
he probably won't ever come back to this town.

103
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,490
So he wants to create a memory with the man he looks up to, Yoshino-san, before he departs.

104
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,880
Who knew he felt such a way.

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,490
I had no idea.

106
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,870
Okazaki... You were that considerate of me?

107
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,450
You guys shouldn't cry over it.

108
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,750
I see.

109
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,460
Sorry for being so thoughtless.

110
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,080
Then!

111
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,680
Yeah. I'll try to make some time.

112
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,890
What do you all want with me?

113
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,630
Let's play baseball!

114
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,530
No.

115
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,370
Bye.

116
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,950
It looks like it's better for you to stay quiet.

117
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,230
Why?

118
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,260
Misae-san, could you hear us out?

119
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,100
You still need something?

120
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,490
Let's play base-

121
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,770
You keep your mouth shut.

122
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,900
Oh, Sakagami-san.

123
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,480
Are you here to ask questions about the student council again?

124
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,280
Not today.

125
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,520
We want to play baseball with you.

126
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,490
Baseball?

127
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,660
Yes. You're... my goal.

128
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,290
And I want to be your rival, as well.

129
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,290
If we can fight through sports, I'm sure there is much that I can learn from you.

130
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,800
Could you come play with us?

131
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,340
I can't say no when I see those eyes.

132
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,130
We managed to get nine people.

133
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,400
Didn't think the last person would be Mei-chan.

134
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,060
I wonder if she'll really come.

135
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,020
Let's have your father come, too.

136
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,530
Let's have him see you working hard.

137
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,030
I want to properly meet your father, too.

138
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,750
Maybe next time.

139
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,790
Yeah?

140
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,250
Tomoya-kun!

141
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,720
Please wait!

142
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,640
I-I-I-It really is Yoshino Yuusuke-san!

143
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,330
I'm glad you were able to get here on time.

144
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,900
When I told her she could meet Yoshino Yuusuke, she came flying over on an overnight bus.

145
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,030
I remember you well, Sagara-san.

146
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,150
You always stood out.

147
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,410
Thank you for your guidance in those days.

148
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,090
Looks like you're getting along well.

149
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,660
Thanks for your concern.

150
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,330
Misae-san and Yoshino-san all knew each other?

151
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,360
Looks like it.

152
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,000
Bring it in, everyone!

153
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,170
Thank you all for coming today.

154
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,710
It's my honor to have you all.

155
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,010
But it's pointless if we lose.

156
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,530
Anyone who screws up will have to eat Sanae's bread.

157
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,650
Play like you mean it!

158
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,700
What does he mean by Sanae's bread?

159
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,560
It's better that you don't know.

160
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,360
The game's starting!

161
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,930
Do your best, Onee-chan.

162
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,300
Good luck, Yuu-kun.

163
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,670
Everyone, fight.

164
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,570
Puhi puhi.

165
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,240
To challenge us with
a jumbled-up team like this...

166
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,570
You've lost your wits.

167
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,120
I'm not sure about that.

168
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,120
This should turn out to be
the most entertaining team.

169
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,750
Strike!

170
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,730
It's fast.

171
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,720
Your brother's the only person who can catch a pitch like that amongst us.

172
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,050
My hand's gonna die!

173
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,560
No one cares about your hand, so make sure you catch it.

174
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,230
Aren't you too harsh?!

175
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,770
Three up and three down.

176
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,510
It's a nice start.

177
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,900
Hey, was he a lefty hitter?

178
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,940
I bet he's thinking the left batter's box is closer to first base.

179
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,520
Faked a swing and bunted instead...

180
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,950
And a pop up, too. So lame.

181
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,650
That's a horrible start for us.

182
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,220
You're a pox on the team.

183
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,260
We're up against a national level pitcher!

184
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,710
Can you hit it?!

185
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,960
Let me show you.

186
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,680
Pretty good.

187
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,010
How's that?

188
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,000
Let me hit third!

189
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,930
Do you not know the rules?

190
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,270
Let's get three runs, shall we?

191
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,270
Akio-san, fight!

192
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,480
Hey! Why don't you face me?!

193
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,140
We have one out and the bases loaded.

194
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,640
We're counting on you, Tomoyo.

195
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,960
It's my first time being the batter.

196
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,310
Switch the grip.

197
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,530
Is this right?

198
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,350
Widen your stance
and lower your center of mass.

199
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,850
When you hit, you run to first base.

200
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,480
Strike!

201
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,330
Tomoyo!

202
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,500
Don't swing at anything that's not in this zone.

203
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,500
Tomoyo-san! Fight!

204
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,420
Take that, you guys!

205
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,350
That's impossible...

206
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,690
Sorry. I made us lose the ball.

207
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,400
It's fine! Go take your lap!

208
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,990
He looks really strong.

209
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,490
Yeah. Can't expect less from
a former high school nationalist.

210
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,800
Are you all right?

211
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,460
Old man!

212
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,710
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

213
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,360
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

214
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,600
N-No, it was an accident.

215
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,400
What do you want to do now?
Do you want to borrow a player from us?

216
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,230
Don't be a fool!
That'd make this game pointless.

217
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,010
We can't lose for the sake of this town.

218
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,110
Pitcher change.

219
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,940
Relief pitcher,

220
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,620
Furukawa Nagisa!

221
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,080
Will Nagisa-chan be all right?

222
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:59,420
When a person with good athleticism pitches, they're more prone to getting hit.

223
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,590
On the other hand, a slow, arcing ball
thrown by a bad pitcher is harder to hit.

224
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,340
Nagisa! Fight!

225
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,420
Puhi puhi!

226
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,070
Nagisa, take it easy!

227
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,430
Even if you get hit, we're here to cover you.

228
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,050
Yes. Thank you very much.

229
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,500
Come on, Nagisa-chan!

230
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:26,950
Tomoyo!

231
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,820
Out!

232
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,200
I managed to hold on for
the inning thanks to everyone.

233
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,940
It's nothing to worry about.

234
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,490
That's what we're there for.

235
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,390
Okazaki!

236
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,040
Make sure to get on base before me!

237
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,800
Don't ask for the impossible from a person with a bad shoulder.

238
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,300
Strike! Batter out!

239
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,530
Proabablity of the first ball being on the low-in trajectory: 62%.

240
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,370
Length of the bat: 800mm.

241
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,270
Diameter of the ball: 70mm.

242
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,960
Incorporate my arm length, range of motion, and the pitch speed into the calculation,

243
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,680
then I'm sure I can hit it.

244
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,950
It's a texas hit.

245
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,280
Kotomi, run!

246
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,990
Safe!

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,460
I did it!

248
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm up next.

249
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,540
Time to go get my name tarnished.

250
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,940
That's a horrible time.

251
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,300
Out!

252
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,720
Are you an idiot?

253
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,330
Kotomi was on the base and you totally ruined it.

254
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,040
You suck, Sunohara.

255
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,760
So lame...

256
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,030
Indeed the time to tarnish your name.

257
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,820
No outs, runner at third.

258
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,250
Another moment of trial.

259
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,080
You can do it, Nagisa-chan!

260
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,440
It's going to right!

261
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,050
I caught it!

262
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,870
Kotomi!

263
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,630
Throw it back home!

264
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,140
Hurry! Throw it!

265
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,150
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,550
I forgot about the tag up.

267
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,760
Don't worry. You limited us to giving up only one run.

268
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,070
You did fine.

269
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,170
We just have to get it back.

270
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,510
Swing away!

271
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,600
Our girls are amazing.

272
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,100
They're getting one hit after another off a former nationalist.

273
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,140
It's no outs with runners on 1st and 3rd bases!

274
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,230
Who's up next?

275
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,440
Oh yeah, it's you.

276
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,170
A squeeze will do.

277
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,070
S-quiz?

278
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,950
What kind of quiz is that?

279
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,240
Don't worry and swing with all your might!

280
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,400
Strike! Batter out!

281
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,910
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,180
Who cares? It's our slugger, Tomo-pyon, next.

283
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,680
Don't give me a strange nickname.

284
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,180
Tomoyo-san, hit another home run for us please.

285
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,960
Please.

286
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,090
Don't wanna.

287
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,930
I want to hit a small clean hit like a girl.

288
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,970
Fight!

289
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,190
It's hard to hit a girl-like hit.

290
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,830
Okazaki-san!

291
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,530
The best thing I can do with this shoulder is...

292
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,890
Good luck!

293
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:19,950
Out.

294
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,960
Not my kind of play.

295
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,150
But not a bad tactic.

296
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,400
Okazaki.

297
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,180
You've fallen to the pits.

298
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,210
It's better than ending up in a double play like someone.

299
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,640
That's not true!

300
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,100
If you're a man, you've got to challenge things!

301
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,170
Nice one, Misae-chan!

302
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,810
Don't call me that!

303
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,750
That's the way I like it.

304
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,000
Yoshino-san, good luck.

305
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,940
Yeah.

306
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,920
Strike!

307
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,910
I couldn't contribute to any plays so far,

308
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,440
but for the sake of the kids here, I will hit.

309
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,920
Strike!

310
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,210
Fight!

311
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:12,880
Here's my...

312
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,130
...gift...

313
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,760
...to all of you!

314
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,790
So this scene still exists, eh?

315
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,310
Children.

316
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,310
This is the best gift I can give you right now.

317
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,320
A gift without shape called memory.

318
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,350
I don't have money.

319
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,320
I can't buy you anything with shape.

320
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,030
Even so-

321
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,100
Out!

322
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,420
He really hasn't changed.

323
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,230
Sorry about that.

324
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,300
They finally turned the tables around.

325
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,540
Fight, everyone.

326
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,880
I'm sorry.

327
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,290
It's not your fault, Nagisa-chan.

328
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,840
They're just too strong.

329
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,230
It was off your wild throw that the last run advanced.

330
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,830
Before that, you made the wrong play.

331
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:07,320
It was also you who missed the pop fly and let the runner who scored the 5th run reach base.

332
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,290
I locked up.

333
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,570
One down...

334
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,700
Nagisa, go on.

335
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,900
Yes.

336
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,110
Calm down, Nagisa-san.

337
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,850
Concentrate, Nagisa-chan.

338
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,910
Swing as hard as you can.

339
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,980
Relax, relax.

340
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,550
Don't worry about getting out.

341
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,380
Swing hard so you won't regret anything.

342
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,270
So I won't regret...

343
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,410
I did it!

344
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,880
Good! Now that's my daughter!

345
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,050
I'll hit as hard as I can!

346
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,770
Can't do anything about that one. It was unlucky.

347
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,670
Am I smiling right now?

348
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,780
No, not at all.

349
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,200
Sorry for being like this...

350
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,990
Sorry for being so pathetic...

351
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,310
Sorry for being this kind of memory...

352
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,280
But!

353
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,320
I will smile in the end!

354
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,570
Good luck, Yuu-kun!

355
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,070
Here's my gift to you all!

356
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,070
All right, we have two runners on base.

357
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,420
Children.

358
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,780
This is the best gift

359
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,870
Time out.

360
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,200
This is the best gift I can give you right now.

361
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,920
A gift without form called memory.

362
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,210
I don't have money.

363
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,940
I can't buy you anything with form.

364
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,150
Even so, even without a form, memory will prevail forever!

365
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,120
I believe that it will.

366
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,810
Are you done?

367
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,340
Yeah, thanks.

368
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,160
Good job, Yuu-kun.

369
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,290
I'm touched by your words, Yoshino-san!

370
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,590
Hey brat.

371
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,790
It's two outs, bases loaded.

372
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,100
You can't go for a squeeze.

373
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,310
Everything's up to you now.

374
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,500
But my shoulder is...

375
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,710
Okazai-san!

376
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,860
Fight.

377
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,860
You'd better let Nagisa step on home plate.

378
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,530
Please give it your best, Okazaki-kun.

379
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,870
You can hit it, Okazaki.

380
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,490
Good luck, Tomoya-kun.

381
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,710
Bring the win back to this town.

382
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,440
Misae-san. May I come visit your home again?

383
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,820
Sure. Come any time you like.

384
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,170
Sorry for the wait!

385
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,820
Eat all you like.

386
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,940
It looks very, very good.

387
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,980
Puhi puhi!

388
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,890
I've been wondering all this time, but who is she?

389
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,340
Nagisa-chan's sister?

390
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,080
Something like that.

391
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,440
Babe sisters, eh?

392
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,140
Nagisa-san. I have a favor to ask.

393
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,210
Yes?

394
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,550
Um-

395
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,230
That seriously felt good.

396
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,680
This has got to be the strongest possible team.

397
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,940
You looked really good out there.

398
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,440
Let's play another game with this member!

399
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,070
If it's for the cause of making memories, call me anytime.

400
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,570
Let's get this started.

401
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,340
To celebrate the Furukawa Bakers' victory.

402
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,510
Cheers!

403
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,920
Run!

404
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,620
Yes!

405
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:56,470
Sunohara-san. Do you have a goal or something you want to do?

406
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,290
I've never thought about it.

407
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,790
I can't go to college, so I'll find a job and work.

408
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:13,090
Well, if I had a level-headed girlfriend, too, I bet my sister would feel more at ease.

409
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,140
That's it!

410
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,510
Good luck, Sunohara-san.
