2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,850
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,400
Akio-san went out when I took
my eyes off of him for a second.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,770
Oh, and I had something important to say today.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,260
I heard about your father.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,890
I'm sorry for worrying you.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,160
Please! No one was bothered by it.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,200
Neither Nagisa, Akio-san, nor I.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,820
But society was.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,030
As proof, I lost a position due to this.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,120
But there's more than one path to take.

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,790
I'm sure she's ready to take any path with you.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,140
Yes. She did say that.

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,710
Please have faith in her.

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,080
Thank you very much.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,690
Sorry to make you wait.

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,760
Let's have some tea, shall we?

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,050
Yes.

19
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,530
Also, if you don't mind,
would you try the latest bread?

20
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,490
I'll bring some out right now.

21
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,270
Hey, my beloved daughter's here.

22
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,740
Yes, I'm back.

23
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,020
Were you out playing baseball again?

24
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,620
No, I wasn't.

25
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,280
Speaking of it, what are you doing here?

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,780
I called in and said I had something to say, so I'd be stopping by!

27
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,310
You're just here to buy bread, so don't make it so formal.

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,290
I'm not here to buy bread.

29
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,780
Just so you know, you're not getting any discount even if you're my daughter's boyfriend.

30
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,470
I'll charge you double instead!

31
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,940
But Sanae's bread is a different story.

32
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,740
You can buy those at the listed price.

33
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,650
Mom's standing behind you.

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,720
So my... my bread is...

35
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,270
...meant to be bought at the listed price?!

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,270
Wait!

37
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,610
What's the problem with selling it at the listed price?!

38
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,080
Mom!

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,410
I love them-

40
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,140
Old man!

41
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,730
I've got something important to tell you.

42
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,540
Please listen.

43
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,530
Oh, something to tell me?

44
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,780
Yeah. A serious talk.

45
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,660
All right. In that case...

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,240
It's time we settle this seriously.

47
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,730
I haven't been this excited in a while.

48
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,690
Why does it turn out this way?

49
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,370
I'm called the baker Cy Young around the neighborhood.

50
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,950
Try to hit my 170 kph fastball!

51
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,610
You do know I have a bad shoulder.

52
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,300
It was you who ended a game sometime ago.

53
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,090
I'm not gonna ask for a home run from you.

54
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,090
Hit something that looks like it'll be a hit.

55
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,260
We'll say you win if it's not a grounder or a pop-up.

56
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,590
Are you really fine with that?

57
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,910
Yeah. If you win, I'll listen to what you have to say.

58
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,120
Not just listen.

59
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,220
Promise to accept whatever I say.

60
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,220
Tomoy-

61
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,910
Fine.

62
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,160
If you win, I'll accept anything you say.

63
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,910
But if I win, I'm not gonna bother.

64
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,370
Is that all right?

65
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,290
Yeah.

66
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,210
This is interesting.

67
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,790
Ready, brat?

68
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,320
Come again whenever you want to challenge me.

69
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,920
Tomoya-kun.

70
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,450
Sorry.

71
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,670
To miss the chance because of something stupid like this.

72
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,970
You might achieve it if you keep working for it.

73
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,090
How about another try for Nagisa's sake?

74
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,850
What are you doing?

75
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,900
I have a battle that'll determine the life waiting for me!

76
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,660
This brat doesn't know when to give up.

77
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,910
Tomoya-kun.

78
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,120
Good luck to both of you!

79
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,910
Try to hit my forkball that drops a whole meter!

80
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,750
Go be a pro.

81
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,850
Come again.

82
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,140
Why do we have to battle in this weather?!

83
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,770
Weather means nothing in serious matches!

84
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,270
The bath's ready for you!

85
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,560
It's not going to make any difference no matter how many times you try.

86
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,030
This is your last chance.

87
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,340
Understood.

88
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,690
You won't win.

89
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,050
That's how big the gap in strength is between us.

90
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,550
Tomoya-kun.

91
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,060
I think he knows.

92
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,460
Knows what?

93
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,820
I feel like he hinted it to me.

94
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,440
"You're still just a kid."

95
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,700
"You're a fool to try to protect someone else."

96
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,820
You're thinking too much.

97
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,720
Akio-san is always like that.

98
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,620
Come, let's go back.

99
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,320
No, I'm going to stay here.

100
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,310
If there's a gap in strength,
then all I have left is passion.

101
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,380
I'll keep practicing.

102
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,170
But-

103
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,470
That is right.

104
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,960
Mom!

105
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,640
I won't stop you this time.

106
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,390
Since, after all, it's a very important thing.

107
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,930
Thank you very much.

108
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,880
I'll return to where Akio-san is.

109
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,640
You should come, too.

110
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,730
But...

111
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,640
Nagisa. You mustn't get in their way when men battle.

112
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,890
Okay.

113
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Nagisa?

114
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,060
Dad.

115
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,690
Old man.

116
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,570
It sure rains a lot.

117
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,490
Is it one of those rainy autumns?

118
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,220
This really is the last pitch.

119
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,120
Got that?

120
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,350
Tomoya-kun!

121
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,370
It's a home run!

122
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,570
Please give Nagisa to me!

123
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,010
He really is like me.

124
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,030
I knew that from long ago.

125
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,340
He's really like you.

126
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,510
I was frantic to become an adult.

127
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,840
And I was still just a kid back then, too.

128
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,010
Exactly.

129
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,860
Lift your head up.

130
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,520
If Nagisa goes through anything sad,
I'm gonna snatch her away from you.

131
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,920
Then...

132
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,110
Dad!

133
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,620
Tomoya-san.

134
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,400
Nagisa is our dream.

135
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,870
And starting today, you are our dream, as well.

136
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,670
The happiness between you two is our dream.

137
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,070
So please seize your happiness.

138
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,600
Winter came.

139
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,030
This time, I spent Christmas alone with Nagisa.

140
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,840
I've been waiting for this year to come!

141
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,490
The day I can drink with my daughter!

142
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,630
You've never had alcohol before, right?

143
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,290
No. This is my first time.

144
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,960
You don't have to force yourself, Nagisa.

145
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,040
No, I will at least drink one cup for Dad's sake.

146
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,150
Nagisa...

147
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,190
I've never been so glad to have given birth to you more than today.

148
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,770
Don't feel that over something like this.

149
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,940
Here I go.

150
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,660
Yay! Look at her go!

151
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,510
Hey, are you really all right?

152
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,590
You're sitting so far away...

153
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,640
Now you're closer...

154
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,300
You're completely drunk.

155
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,200
No, I'm not!

156
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,490
That's what everyone says when they're drunk.

157
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,440
Tomoya-kun...

158
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,800
What a lovey-dovey couple.

159
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,650
Does this count as lovey-dovey, too?

160
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,610
Tomoya-kun!

161
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,570
Yes!

162
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,960
Is Mom that interesting to you?!

163
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,720
What are you saying all of a sudden?!

164
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,270
I'd like to know the truth to that, too.

165
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,770
Why are you drinking, too?!

166
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,500
Are you interested in me, Tomoya-san?

167
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,380
Are you, Tomoya-kun?!

168
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,520
A hell of a battle this is.

169
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,130
One of them is your wife, you know?!

170
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,130
Answer me, Tomoya-kun!

171
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,890
This is very exciting.

172
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,690
Listen, I'm-

173
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,890
Sanae has huge boobs, you know?

174
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,360
Tomoya-kun! Why are you panicking like that?

175
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,390
It's proof he's interested in Sanae.

176
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,850
I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! I'm not!

177
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,030
You're not?

178
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,830
I mean, I do like you.

179
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,370
As a person, that is.

180
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,400
So you do like her?!

181
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,110
What the heck did I do to deserve this?!

182
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,340
Stop playing with him now.

183
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,100
What's so great about being liked by him?

184
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,980
I'm not playing with him.

185
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,370
I'm serious.

186
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,550
What?!

187
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,750
Make up your mind!

188
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,750
Sanae! What are you thinking?!

189
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,610
She's sound asleep.

190
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,880
Nagisa's very blessed.

191
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,360
Yeah.

192
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,670
How about you, Tomoya-san?

193
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,750
Of course I am.

194
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,800
I'll be happy as long as
I can be with her forever.

195
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,060
When third semester came around, Nagisa became sick again.

196
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,870
Maybe I took you around too much over the break.

197
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,210
No. I'm always like this during this season.

198
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,920
Will you be able to graduate?

199
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,500
Apparently that's fine.

200
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,630
I have enough attendance even if I skip the rest of school.

201
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,530
I see.

202
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,310
Then that's great.

203
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,110
Yes.

204
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,560
Sign: Hikarizaka Private High School Graduation

205
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,310
The day of graduation.

206
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,790
Nagisa sat looking out toward the school.

207
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,570
Yes, this is Sunohara.

208
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,970
Is that Mei-chan?

209
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,110
This is Okazaki.

210
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,850
Okazaki-san?!

211
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,400
It's been so long!

212
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,670
How have you been?

213
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,430
Great!

214
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,460
Are you and Nagisa-san doing well, too?

215
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,960
So-so, I guess.

216
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,230
Is Sunohara there?

217
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,840
Onii-chan's living at the dorm, so he's not here.

218
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,590
Dorm?

219
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,410
The company dorm.

220
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,930
Would you like his number?

221
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,230
Thank you for waiting.

222
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,180
Hey, Sunohara. It's me, Okazaki.

223
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,510
Okazaki? Seriously?

224
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,130
Yeah. How have you been?

225
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,780
Good, but...

226
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,410
This company's pretty unreasonable.

227
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,610
Here, listen...

228
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,720
I'll listen to you next time.

229
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,980
Right now, listen to what I say.

230
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,010
You see...

231
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,460
Yeah, whenever is best for you.

232
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,430
I'll have to make it work with everyone else's schedule, but I'll find a way.

233
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,200
Please.

234
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,380
I'm right in the middle of the training period, so I'll get fired if I leave the dorm without permission.

235
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,340
Thanks for your help.

236
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,720
You're telling me to get fired?!

237
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,960
A day wouldn't kill you, would it?

238
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,510
Don't make it sound so easy.

239
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,400
This company's really inflexible.

240
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,230
Please! Think of it as a favor for me!

241
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,080
You mean for Nagisa-chan, right?

242
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,500
Well, if it's just one day,
I think I can make it happen.

243
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,360
Thanks a bunch.

244
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,830
I'm such a good guy to go through
all this for someone else's girlfriend.

245
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,690
That's why I'm asking you.

246
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,970
Fine.

247
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,870
You can catch me at this hour, so call again.

248
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,820
Yeah, I will.

249
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,010
It's really beautiful.

250
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,720
Glad you came, right?

251
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,510
Walking like this reminds me of the days
we walked to school together.

252
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,020
Me, too.

253
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,310
Can we enter without permission?

254
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,100
Don't worry. I already got permission.

255
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,310
Nagisa!

256
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,870
Hey!

257
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,710
Nagisa-chan.

258
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,950
Long time no see.

259
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,230
Who are you?

260
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,620
How can you say that after seeing me for the first time in ages?

261
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,000
Anyone would laugh.

262
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,700
I thought it was someone else at first, too.

263
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,680
Puhi puhi!

264
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,940
Until you two came,
we were playing with Sunohara.

265
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,650
I was surprised at first, too.

266
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,940
It's not him without the blond hair.

267
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,700
Then how about we all dye it for him?

268
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,110
I'll get fired from work!

269
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,640
How are you, Furukawa-san?

270
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,950
Yes, I'm doing well now.

271
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,360
It's really great that we were all able to gather like this.

272
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,210
Yeah. It was a shame you
couldn't come to the graduation.

273
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,530
Both Rie-chan and I managed to work out our schedules.

274
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,130
Don't you think it's a small miracle we were all able to get together?

275
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,270
If I were to add a word, it's a miracle of love.

276
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,140
That's exactly right, Yoshino-san!

277
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,640
Um, I'm still having trouble
understanding what's going on.

278
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,480
It's the graduation.

279
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,730
Your graduation.

280
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:05,000
Koumura-sensei asked the school for permission to use the campus for today's event.

281
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,790
I can't deny a favor asked by my last student.

282
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,460
Thank you very much.

283
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,150
We will now start the graduation ceremony.

284
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,110
Furukawa Nagisa.

285
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,150
Yes.

286
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,140
Certificate of graduation.

287
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,830
We certify that you have met all the criteria set forth by this school.

288
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,830
Thank you very much.

289
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,860
I experienced lots of hardships at this school.

290
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,280
I'm shy, withdrawn, and bad at making friends.

291
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,270
After becoming a senior, I couldn't attend enough classes and had to repeat the year.

292
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:35,220
The spring of my second senior year, I was alone in my new class.

293
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:43,870
When I learned that there's nothing that doesn't change with the flow of time, I couldn't move.

294
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,230
So I stood helplessly at the bottom of the hill.

295
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,900
And, it was Tomoya-kun who gave me a push to my back.

296
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,530
Since then, I've met many people.

297
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,280
With the support of everyone here, I formed the Theater Club.

298
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,290
At the School Festival, I was even able to stand on the stage.

299
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:16,370
But soon after that, I became ill again,
and had to repeat the senior year once more.

300
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,800
Even so, I thought I'd give it my best.

301
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,140
I wanted to be stronger.

302
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,160
I have a weak body, but I wanted to live strong.

303
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,850
The ones who gave me the strength to do that are all of you here.

304
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:42,140
I ended up in a different class from Tomoyo-san, Miyazawa-san, and Nishina-san,

305
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,150
so I spent most of this year alone.

306
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,330
Even... Even so...

307
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,900
I think of the school days here as very valuable ones!

308
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,540
It took me five years to graduate, but I love this school.

309
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,870
That's because this is the place I worked so hard at.

310
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,390
Thank you very much.

311
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,690
Congratulations for graduating.

312
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,690
Nagisa's long...

313
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,990
...long school days...

314
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,250
...just...

315
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,610
...ended.

316
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,980
I'm going to be married to her.

317
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,130
I see.

318
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,620
Congratulations.

319
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,220
Thank you very much.

320
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,850
Ah... Nagisa-san, was it?

321
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,470
Yes. I'm Nagisa.

322
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,720
Please take care of Tomoya-kun.

323
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,620
I'll be in your care, too.

324
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,310
I wish you a happy life.

325
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,310
We dropped off our marriage registration.

326
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,070
Okazaki Nagisa.

327
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,700
That's Nagisa's name starting today.

328
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:11,240
Calm down. I've heard the sound of Nagisa showering in that house many times.

329
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,310
What's wrong?!

330
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,870
I'm sorry. The water coming out was cold.
