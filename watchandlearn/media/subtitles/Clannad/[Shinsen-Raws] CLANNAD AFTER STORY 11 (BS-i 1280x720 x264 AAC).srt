2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,080
Tomoya-kun.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,800
It's morning, Tomoya-kun.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,050
Breakfast is ready, Tomoya-kun.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,050
Oh, good morning.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,070
Ow...

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,070
Sorry about this every morning.

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,250
I don't mind at all.

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,080
How about you? Is your body all right?

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,580
No, it's starting to get better, but it still screams everywhere.

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,160
Please don't overwork yourself.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,800
Yeah.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,470
Good morning!

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,850
Yo.

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,060
So you're here. Hurry and get changed.

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,080
Yes.

17
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,750
You're not holding the spanner right.

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,500
I showed you how it's done many times.

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,330
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,160
You're using too much adhesive.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,480
And screw them in diagonal order.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,170
Have you forgotten?

23
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,290
I'm sorry!

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,610
Concentrate. You'll get hurt if you don't.

25
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,090
Yes.

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,720
I'm home.

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,810
Welcome back.

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,810
I bought pork so you'll get your energy back.

29
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,780
Really? Thanks.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,290
It'll be ready soon, so please sit and rest.

31
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,530
The bath is ready, too.

32
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,300
Yeah.

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,370
I said that's mine.

34
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,280
No~

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,080
If you want it, go buy your own!

36
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,270
All right~

37
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,270
Are you sleepy, Tomoya-kun?

38
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,290
No, I'm fine.

39
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,090
I'm being supported by Nagisa right now.

40
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,050
Nagisa worries and comes to see me every day.

41
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,030
That's all it takes me to keep working hard without giving up.

42
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,450
Why do you do everything the hard way?

43
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,210
What are you talking about?

44
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,700
It's easier to use both hands.

45
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,870
Why don't you use your right hand more?

46
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,330
No, the way I do it is easier for me.

47
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,770
Fine. It's not like you're doing things out of order.

48
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,840
Let's see, I would prefer...

49
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,600
Tomoya-kun. Tomoya-kun.

50
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,090
Oh, what is it, Nagisa?

51
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,700
I've been calling you for a while and you never answered.

52
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,360
Sorry. I was thinking about work.

53
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,900
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,150
Why are you apologizing?

55
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,240
You're having tough days at work,
yet I'm bombarding you with conversation.

56
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,410
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,910
What are you talking about?!

58
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,830
Because you talk about lots of stuff, you're giving me a breather.

59
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,760
Isn't it better for you to tell Yoshino-san that you have a bad right shoulder?

60
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't. They might not let me work.

61
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,810
You think so?

62
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,160
Even if Yoshino-san is all right with it,
the manager might not be.

63
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,590
That place pays pretty well for its size.

64
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,270
I'll be out on the street the moment I lose my job.

65
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,300
But please be careful of injuries.

66
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,990
Yeah, I know.

67
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,180
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

68
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,160
Good night.

69
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,700
What's wrong?

70
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,380
Tomoya-kun, aren't you lonely?

71
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,210
After I leave, you're alone in that room.

72
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,760
When I think of that, I'm sometimes on the verge of crying.

73
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,680
Idiot. What's there to cry about?

74
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,380
You might be right, but...

75
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,680
I go to bed as soon as I'm alone,
so there's nothing to worry about.

76
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,270
Don't worry about a thing and go home.

77
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,360
Okay. Good night.

78
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,500
What are we doing?

79
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,970
We need picture proof at the end of construction.

80
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,410
Hold this.

81
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,690
Good work, Yoshino-san.

82
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,050
Hey.

83
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,300
Kinoshita-san!

84
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,920
Kinoshita-san, you know him?

85
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,800
I used to work in the same office as Tomoya-kun's father.

86
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,240
I visited his home several times, too.

87
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,210
You've grown so much.

88
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,570
I'm surprised to see you in a place like this, too.

89
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,380
Since the last office busted, I transferred to the one I'm working in now.

90
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,360
Is your father doing well?

91
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,630
Actually, I'm living alone now, so I haven't seen him recently.

92
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,840
We work in various locations, so chance encounters like this happen once in a while.

93
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,130
It's moments like these that you feel how small the world is.

94
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,090
To me, it feels like the world just got bigger.

95
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,100
You're looking at that pretty intently.

96
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,350
Looking at this makes me think how buildings grow without me knowing.

97
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,840
Things will change more.

98
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,530
When a new road opens, new office buildings and shops will stand alongside it.

99
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,500
A big hospital will be built soon, too.

100
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,620
Really?

101
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,890
Though, I might not want to see too many changes too quickly.

102
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,340
Do you want to go somewhere next Sunday?

103
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,840
Ah, I'm sorry. There's a mock exam on Sunday.

104
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,420
Mock exam? I thought you weren't going to college.

105
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,400
Even so, I want to take
the exam like everyone else.

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,350
So, I'm sorry, but...

107
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,060
I see.

108
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,280
We're kind of missing each other a lot recently.

109
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,860
Don't worry about it. Do your best and get a good score.

110
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,420
I will.

111
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,540
So why do I have to come with you?

112
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,430
Don't hate me like that.

113
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,270
I just happen to have time today, too.

114
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,250
Let's have some adult
entertainment today, shall we?

115
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,990
Adult entertainment?

116
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,940
This is the toy store I visit regularly.

117
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,220
You're a regular?

118
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,380
'ello!

119
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,940
Stop moving!

120
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,330
Oh, he's got slow reflexes for someone you bring.

121
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,140
He's an amateur, so give him a break.

122
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,830
There are pros at this thing?!

123
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,840
We'll call it draw for today.

124
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,170
So that makes it 123 wins,
171 losses, and 32 draws for me.

125
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,640
This is your idea of adult entertainment?

126
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,430
The real thing starts here.

127
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,930
Hey. Is it ready?

128
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,390
You bet.

129
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,390
Open it.

130
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,410
What is this?

131
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,060
A Bengal Giant Lizard, Mr. Lizard.

132
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,600
How very literal.

133
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,900
We'll slip this down Sanae's back and surprise her!

134
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,910
Just thinking about it makes my heart rejoice.

135
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,200
No way.

136
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,410
Don't you feel bad for Sanae-san? You should stop it.

137
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't worry. It's stimulus that keeps the relationship between husband and wife fresh.

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,690
You should remember it.

139
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,530
Is it really something like that?

140
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,260
It's been a while, Tomoya-san.

141
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,990
Yes, hello.

142
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,260
By the way, Sanae, what was
your least favorite animal again?

143
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,670
The Bengal Giant Lizard.

144
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,350
So specific!

145
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,250
Yeah, right?

146
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,430
Look! There's the Bengal Giant Lizard!

147
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,900
Wh-Where?

148
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,180
Look, it's gone over there!

149
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,440
I'm sorry, Sanae-san.

150
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,490
Oh no! It went down your back!

151
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,130
No!!!

152
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,960
Someone get it out please!

153
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,410
Crap. That's more than a little stimulus.

154
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,040
What are you going to do about it?!

155
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,920
Sanae! I didn't do it!

156
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,790
You cheap bastard!

157
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,170
Wow, they're running faster than usual.

158
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,640
Isogai-san. I'm sorry about the noise.

159
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,770
It's all right. Everyone around here says
every day is entertaining thanks to those two.

160
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,850
Really?

161
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,280
Someone please get it out!

162
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,730
Wait, Sanae!

163
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,790
Sorry, I need to get going.

164
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,420
Sure. Don't worry, I'll mind the store for you.

165
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,410
I'm sorry about this.

166
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,240
I was really surprised today.

167
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,330
When I got home, Dad, Mom, and you were all running.

168
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,750
Maybe Sanae-san hates me now.

169
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,860
I'm sure not.

170
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,990
You get along very well with both Dad and Mom.

171
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,380
But I dropped the Bengal Giant Lizard down her back.

172
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,110
No one has ever run with Dad and Mom before.

173
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,520
So I think you really bonded with them today.

174
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,270
You think so?

175
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:55,140
By the way, Tomoya-kun. Do you know what happens two Sundays from today?

176
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,510
Two Sundays from today?

177
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,530
Your birthday is December, so...

178
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,620
It's the Founders Festival.

179
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:08,170
The Theater Club is gone,
but I want to have lots of fun.

180
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,210
So if it's all right...

181
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,300
Sure. Let's go together.

182
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,120
Yes!

183
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,440
Today was a rough day.

184
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,460
But I like since we get overtime.

185
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,700
Hey, good work.

186
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,150
Organizing the stubs?

187
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,850
I'm having him help me a little.

188
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,080
I can't make much progress alone.

189
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,840
Impressive.

190
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,870
I'm only organizing them by date.

191
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,370
Even so.

192
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,000
I'd snap in five minutes.

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,510
You want me to help you with this pile?

194
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,760
No, that's the finished pile.

195
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,840
Forget it. You'll ruin it if you touch it.

196
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,650
Hey, I was working as an accountant before I got fired from my old job.

197
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,940
No good to take rookie's job, Mister.

198
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,400
I'll be done soon, so please head home.

199
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,190
If you say so. See you.

200
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,860
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.

201
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,660
See you.

202
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,450
See you.

203
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,730
See you, Manager.

204
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,330
See you.

205
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,690
It's a great help to have you come.

206
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,350
We were short on people despite the expectation of getting a big job soon.

207
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,290
I can't do anything yet.

208
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,340
That's not true.

209
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,050
I hear he makes you do many tasks alone.

210
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,210
You'll probably end up coming on weekends more frequently, but keep it up.

211
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,620
Founders. Founders. Next weekend is the~

212
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,980
~Founders Festival~

213
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,690
Nagisa.

214
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,360
Yes, what is it?

215
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,610
Apparently things will get busy from now on.

216
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,830
I might not be able to go to the Founders Festival.

217
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,130
Sorry, when we're already losing our time together.

218
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,570
Please don't worry.

219
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,840
I think it's great for the work to be busy.

220
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,550
Nagisa.

221
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:30,430
It's a bit of a shame, but I'm happy that you're working so hard.

222
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,100
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,480
Give me the cutters.

224
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,380
Coming.

225
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,000
Also, give me 210 mm of Sanshin's VVF cable.

226
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,990
Have the two ends stripped.

227
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,560
How much do you want it stripped?

228
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,280
I'll strip 2cm if it's thick.

229
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,680
Strip 4cm and it'll be multipurpose.

230
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,770
Make a note of that.

231
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,310
Oh, that's true.

232
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,210
Roger that.

233
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,330
Have a 38 wrapper ready.

234
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,890
Protective tubing, right?

235
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,890
Standard or extra?

236
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,790
Let's go with extra just in case.

237
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,140
We don't want to see it catch fire later.

238
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,640
Finish this up.

239
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,880
I'll go check the next one.

240
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Okay.

241
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,440
Don't rush, and do it neatly.

242
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,210
I'll come back when I'm done.

243
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,530
Okay.

244
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,720
Yes. So I'd like a day off tomorrow if possible.

245
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,150
I see. Don't worry. We don't have to give up our weekend tomorrow.

246
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,220
Really?!

247
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,600
How's your right shoulder doing?

248
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,130
You can't lift your arm up, right?

249
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,980
I can tell just by looking.

250
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,930
So you noticed.

251
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,360
Then why didn't you say anything?

252
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,120
What will happen if I say something?

253
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,280
You're not doing any procedures wrong.

254
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,370
You were trying to overcome your handicap.

255
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,620
Trying very hard to.

256
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,690
But difficult work will be coming in from now on.

257
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,160
If you think it's too much, then don't do it.

258
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,840
I'll cover you in those situations.

259
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,620
Is that all right? Won't that only trouble you?

260
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,130
What can't be done will be covered by others.

261
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,840
That's what work is about.

262
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,040
I'll have you do things I can't do.

263
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,700
That's the way it goes.

264
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,110
Basically, make sure you don't screw anything up and sadden your girl.

265
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,780
Thank you very much.

266
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,080
Man, everyone went home.

267
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,650
What's the matter?

268
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,050
A job got slipped out of the pile by mistake.

269
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,070
It's this.

270
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,620
Do you think you can do it?

271
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,980
If it's this, I can.

272
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,760
It's the same thing I always do.

273
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,930
Really? Then sorry, but can you go do it now?

274
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,780
By myself?

275
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,520
I've got other things to do and can't go.

276
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,370
I'll give you a ride to the place, so please.

277
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,070
I'll come pick you up later, too.

278
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,700
Okay.

279
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,080
Yoshino-san.

280
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,980
Manager gave me a call,
so I ran back to the office.

281
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,300
Did you manage it alone?

282
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,970
Yes, I think.

283
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,140
Have you checked the junctions?

284
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,160
Yes. At each circuit
and the entire thing at the end.

285
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,020
Did you strip the insulation?

286
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,560
Yes. And I measured them, too.

287
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,160
Good work.

288
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,780
It's late already, so let's go back.

289
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,530
Yes!

290
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,540
I'll be at school.

291
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,790
Yeah. We'll meet at the gate later.

292
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,970
Yes.

293
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,050
Hello.

294
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,360
Okazaki-kun. Do you know what happened on-site yesterday?

295
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:48,450
Yoshino just called in and said he noticed a mistake, so he'd go fix it.

296
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,830
He won't tell me even when I asked him to explain.

297
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,580
So I thought you might know something.

298
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,550
Yoshino-san!

299
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,120
Okazaki! What are you doing here?!

300
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,840
"What"?

301
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,870
I'm sorry!

302
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,030
If I had done it properly...

303
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,110
It's not your fault.

304
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,920
It is!

305
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,220
I noticed it after you went home.

306
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,740
But it was already nighttime,
so I rolled the work over to today.

307
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,760
It was my mistake for not noticing your mistake on-site.

308
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,100
You have a promise with Nagisa-san, don't you?

309
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,280
Hurry and go.

310
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,870
Please let me take responsibility!

311
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,670
No!

312
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,770
Please!

313
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Bring up 6m of 25 low-pressure extension cable.

314
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,700
What?

315
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,080
Get a move on!

316
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,520
Yes!

317
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,890
Sign: Founders Festival

318
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,610
Tomoya-kun.

319
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,150
Nagisa...

320
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,660
So you were at work.

321
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,650
I had a feeling that you were.

322
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,410
You're drenched in sweat.

323
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,270
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,120
You've done nothing to apologize about.

325
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,880
Will you eat these with me?

326
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,490
Let's eat as we go.

327
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,350
Tomoya-kun.

328
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,520
Y-Yeah.

329
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,740
Good morning.

330
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,680
Mr. Okazaki.

331
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,830
I heard you had big job yesterday.

332
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,330
Yes.

333
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,260
We heard from Yoshino-san.

334
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,410
You skipped a date with
your girl and came to work, right?

335
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,170
You should have said so,
and I would have gone for you.

336
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,420
Sorry about that.

337
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,130
I'll make sure to give you overtime pay for the weekend work.

338
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,200
Um, I came thinking I'd get yelled at.

339
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,760
Everyone makes mistakes.

340
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,320
What's important is how to make up for it.

341
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,020
You did your best and we didn't cause any trouble to the client.

342
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,270
Don't make the same mistake, and that's all.

343
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:42,210
If you're feeling sorry, then handle the mistakes the juniors you'll eventually have will make.

344
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,610
That's your job.

345
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,200
And!

346
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,700
Love!

347
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,790
Understood!

348
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,910
I'll remember that!

349
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,800
I think last one word not needed.

350
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,830
All right, enough talking.

351
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,210
Let's get to work.

352
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,970
All right.

353
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,170
Ah, Okazaki-kun.

354
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,510
It's finally done.

355
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,680
Hurry up, Okazaki.

356
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,030
Y-Yes!

357
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,620
I think you look kinder now, too.

358
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,350
I always thought things like that were annoying.

359
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,470
And I say that when at school, I stuck my nose into other people's business so much.

360
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:10,430
I think you should choose
the path you think is the best.

361
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,650
Don't lose track of what's important to you.
