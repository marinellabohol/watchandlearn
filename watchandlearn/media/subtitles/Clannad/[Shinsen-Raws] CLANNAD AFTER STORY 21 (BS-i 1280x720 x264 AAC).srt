2
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,740
It's the same as Nagisa-san.

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,680
Unfortunately, I cannot tell the cause.

4
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,460
But I would guess that the same suffering Nagisa-san went through will come.

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,450
She was...

6
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,810
...running around... until just a moment ago.

7
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,220
I'll be going now.

8
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,240
Tomoya.

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,210
Who's her father?

10
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,790
Me.

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,370
Then you have to keep your head straight.

12
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,110
Are you all right?

13
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,410
Are you cold at all?

14
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,330
As a doll, I don't feel cold.

15
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,540
But I'm sure her hand is cold.

16
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,630
Although I can't even tell that.

17
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,220
The world will soon turn completely white.

18
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,720
We need to hurry a little.

19
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,740
The sports day.

20
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,570
Yeah.

21
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,950
You're not going to run, Daddy?

22
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,450
I'll be with you the whole day.

23
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,330
Akki?

24
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,500
He might run. If two anchors skipped,
they'd have trouble finding two replacements.

25
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,300
Daddy. Beat Akki.

26
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,760
I said I'll be with you.

27
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,220
I don't like this.

28
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,430
So you're on my side, huh?

29
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,730
Yup.

30
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,890
I'm on your side, too.

31
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,900
No matter what happens, I'll protect you.

32
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,860
Yup.

33
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,780
Are you sleepy?

34
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,660
Yup.

35
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,160
Don't worry. I won't go anywhere.

36
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,910
Okay.

37
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,250
A week...

38
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,420
Two weeks...

39
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,090
Then a month went by,
and Ushio's fever did not go down.

40
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,880
She couldn't go to kindergarten, much less leave the room.

41
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,930
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,310
I don't want you leaving us.

43
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,560
But, looks like there are various issues.

44
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,410
That was a big decision.

45
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,790
Sanae-san and the old man tried to stop me,

46
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,500
but I want to be with Ushio.

47
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,670
Do you have some savings?

48
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,750
Some.

49
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,050
I was saving up for her education.

50
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,300
I see.

51
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,970
Good work here.

52
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,590
Thank you for your guidance.

53
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,350
Take it. Don't lose it.

54
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,280
Are you sure?

55
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,490
Of course not. How will I work without it from tomorrow on?

56
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,530
Then-

57
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,040
Lend me yours instead.

58
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,330
I'll give it back to you when you return.

59
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,000
Come back when Ushio-chan recovers.

60
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,460
I'll borrow yours until then.

61
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,860
I'll take good care of it.

62
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,030
Ushio stayed home.

63
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,580
We thought about putting her in a hospital but decided not to.

64
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,750
Since we don't know the treatment for it,
there was no point in staying at a hospital.

65
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,960
Most of all, Ushio wanted to stay home.

66
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,170
Let's change into new pajamas.

67
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:49,840
Okay.

68
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,430
You don't have to get up. I'll change you.

69
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,560
I can do it myself.

70
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,740
It's all right if you can't do it yourself right now.

71
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,240
Okay...

72
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,500
Ushio can't get changed alone anymore.

73
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,040
She can't go to the bathroom alone.

74
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,460
She can only eat soft foods.

75
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,760
Won't those peaceful days ever come back again?

76
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,390
Ushio, do you have anything you want?

77
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,520
If you do, tell me.

78
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,570
I'll buy you anything; toys or snacks.

79
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,240
I want to go on a trip.

80
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,070
Trip?

81
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,370
I want to go on a trip with Daddy again.

82
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,950
That wasn't fun at all, was it?

83
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,620
I was in such a bad mood and yelled the entire time.

84
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,080
It was fun.

85
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,710
I want to go on another trip.

86
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,970
On a train with Daddy.

87
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,840
Once you get better, okay?

88
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,350
I want to go now.

89
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,310
Ushio... Don't ask for
the impossible and trouble me.

90
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,700
I can't even grant the one wish my only daughter has?

91
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,990
Nagisa...

92
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,280
What should I do?

93
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,500
If only you were here at times like this.

94
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,130
I'm...

95
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,170
My family might just be getting toyed with by this city.

96
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:58,260
Given happiness, then having it snatched away.

97
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,060
Unforgivable.

98
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,060
I will save Ushio no matter what it takes.

99
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,150
I will save Ushio!

100
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,650
Please look after her.

101
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,360
Have a good trip.

102
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,780
See ya.

103
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,450
Hey.

104
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,910
Take it.

105
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,420
I can't.

106
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,550
Don't be so stubborn.

107
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,260
No, I don't mean it like that.

108
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,470
I still have some savings,
so we'll be fine for a while longer.

109
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,470
I'll beat you up if you're lying to me.

110
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,680
I'm telling the truth.

111
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,640
Then fine.

112
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,230
There are things a man has to protect even if it kills his pride.

113
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,400
Right?

114
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,610
I know.

115
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,900
If I run into something serious, I'll let you know.

116
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,220
Want one?

117
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,970
No, I quit.

118
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,560
That's wise of you.

119
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:30,810
Hey.

120
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:37,780
People built this hospital by
sacrificing the forest that was here.

121
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,950
What will the next sacrifice be?

122
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,580
A hill at the outskirt of town is getting dug up.

123
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,580
Apparently, they're building a shopping mall there.

124
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,540
It'll be convenient, so it's great for people.

125
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,880
Maybe...

126
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:04,850
From the moment you brought the near-death Nagisa here, Nagisa was linked to this city.

127
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,100
And Nagisa's daughter, Ushio, too.

128
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,280
Does... Is going through change a pain for the city?

129
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,370
I think it's got nothing to do with pain.

130
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,700
"Oh, I'm changing."

131
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,960
I think that's all.

132
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:40,380
If people's deaths are a part of changing, then do we have to accept that, too?

133
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,550
People build hospitals because they don't want to do that.

134
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,700
Let this city and its people be blessed.

135
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,380
Are you thirsty?

136
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,920
Do you want some water?

137
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,390
It's cold, so drink slowly.

138
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,640
If you go too fast, you'll get a stomachache.

139
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,650
It's good.

140
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,150
Really?

141
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,320
Daddy.

142
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,160
I want to go on a trip.

143
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,500
Sure. After you get better.

144
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,750
Where do you want to go?

145
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,170
Do you want to go to that flower patch again?

146
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,470
Ah, but going north now would be cold.

147
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,630
Let's go south.

148
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,680
To a place where it's warm, beautiful, and there's clean air.

149
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,890
Or-

150
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,100
I want to go now.

151
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,100
After you get better.

152
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,810
I've told you so many times, haven't I?

153
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,190
Now.

154
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,110
I want to go now.

155
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,280
To the flower patch.

156
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,900
Ushio...

157
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,990
It has to be now.

158
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,910
I want to go with you.

159
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,260
Okay, let's go.

160
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,340
I'll let you have your wish.

161
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,640
Yup.

162
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,680
But you have to let me know when you're not feeling well.

163
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Yup.

164
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,810
Good.

165
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,940
I'll give you a piggy back ride. Here.

166
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,400
I'll walk.

167
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,610
Don't push yourself.

168
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,330
I want to walk with you.

169
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,160
Yeah?

170
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,410
Then let's walk together as much as you can.

171
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,370
Yup.

172
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,420
Let's go!

173
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,460
Let's make this a fun trip.

174
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,340
Ya!

175
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,650
Are you all right, Ushio?

176
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,400
Yup.

177
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,900
You have to let me know the moment you're not feeling well.

178
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,690
We'll go to a doctor then.

179
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,400
Yup.

180
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,010
Ushio...

181
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,800
Let's...

182
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,820
It's snowing.

183
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,420
Do you like snow, Ushio?

184
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,210
Yup.

185
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,170
Do you like it, too?

186
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,880
I...

187
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,220
Yeah, I like it, too.

188
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,520
Can you keep walking, Ushio?

189
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,270
Do you want to rest a little?

190
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,400
No.

191
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,690
Let's get in a car before
it starts coming down hard.

192
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,110
I'll give you a piggy back ride.

193
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,570
I'm fine.

194
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,080
Ushio!

195
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,930
Daddy...

196
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,760
What is it, Ushio?

197
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,720
Where are we?

198
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,140
Are we on the train?

199
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,480
Yeah. We're on the train already.

200
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,400
It's dark... Is it night?

201
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,650
That's right. It's midnight.

202
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,530
Oh...

203
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,660
Daddy?

204
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,160
I love you.

205
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,660
Yeah.

206
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,630
I love you, too, Ushio.

207
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,510
Ushio?

208
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,770
Ushio!

209
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,150
USHIO!

210
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,670
No...

211
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,580
I don't want this.

212
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,210
Nagisa...

213
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,960
Save Ushio.

214
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,470
Nagisa!

215
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,760
Someone... Someone save Ushio!

216
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,180
Nagisa...

217
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,680
Thank you.

218
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,110
How many more steps will it take to get there?

219
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,780
Could we be only a step away?

220
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,080
Or, do we have to walk without end?

221
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,900
I hate this city.

222
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,580
It's full of all the memories I want to forget about.

223
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,540
Go to school every day, chat with friends,

224
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,750
and then go back to the home
I don't even want to go back to.

225
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,180
Will something eventually change, doing this?

226
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,890
Will that day come?

227
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,070
Sweet bean bread!

228
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,530
Do you like this school?

229
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,950
I really, really love it.

230
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,710
But nothing can stay unchanged.

231
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,260
If I talk to her here, Nagisa and I
will meet and eventually date.

232
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,090
But, maybe it was better if I didn't.

233
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,850
It might've been better if we'd never met.
