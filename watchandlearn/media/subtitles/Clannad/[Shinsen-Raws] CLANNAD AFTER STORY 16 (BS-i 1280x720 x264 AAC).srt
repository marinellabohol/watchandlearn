2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,320
You went and brought more junk?

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,920
You're so cold.

4
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,330
Sorry I can't do anything.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,920
Are you going?

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,060
I want you to stay by me.

7
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,830
Please. Let's stay by each other forever.

8
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,700
That's exactly why I have to go...

9
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,250
...so that we can be together forever.

10
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,080
Tomoya-kun, do you have everything you need?

11
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,870
Yeah, I've got 'em.

12
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,000
Shio-chan. Say "goodbye".

13
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,880
I'll be going now.

14
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,170
Have a good day.

15
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,130
Have a good day.

16
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,650
Sanae-san is with Nagisa during the day.

17
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,110
The old man comes frequently, too.

18
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,360
Everyone's doing the best they can so Nagisa can deliver Ushio safely.

19
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,410
Nagisa, see you tomorrow.

20
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,120
Yes, see you tomorrow.

21
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,340
At times, I'm scared that you hate me.

22
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,760
If Nagisa hadn't met me, she wouldn't have to go through this life or death delivery.

23
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,640
I changed Nagisa.

24
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,680
When I first met her, she looked really weak.

25
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,020
So weak it made me think she would've stayed standing at the foot of the hill if I hadn't spoken.

26
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,530
I was giving myself too much credit.

27
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,490
I thought she became stronger because of me.

28
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,620
And I thought I became stronger because of her.

29
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,910
That's exactly right, Tomoya-san.

30
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,920
Both Akio-san and I are very grateful to you.

31
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,290
But I'm starting to question things.

32
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,500
If I weren't here, she would still be at your home,

33
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,930
and though she might have had less friends,
she would be living a happy life of her own.

34
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,560
If not, she might have met someone better than me and be having a happier life.

35
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,680
We can't imagine such a thing, Tomoya-san.

36
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,690
I knew you'd say that since you're a kind person.

37
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,650
But...

38
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,440
I mean it from my heart.

39
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,320
I'm sorry; I acted like a child there.

40
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,870
I continued to work.

41
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,830
A machine that flies.

42
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,670
I will make the machine that will take us from here.

43
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,940
Sign: Tonari-machi Hospital - lit. "Neighboring City Hospital"

44
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,150
It's almost Christmas.

45
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,900
And your birthday at the same time.

46
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,900
What do you want this year?

47
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,570
The Big Dango Family.

48
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,280
What's the point of collecting more of that?

49
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,160
Besides, you won't find them anywhere anymore.

50
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Would it be hard to find?

51
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,670
It's probably impossible.

52
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,080
I see...

53
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,600
How did you find that?

54
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,140
Tomoya-kun went through lots of trouble to find it.

55
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,560
How does getting one every year sound?

56
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,310
You'll eventually get a real "big family".

57
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,480
The older ones will probably get jealous.

58
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,110
But I can't hug all three at once.

59
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,570
So I want you to hug them instead.

60
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,950
Me?

61
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,240
Here you go.

62
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,620
Tomoya-kun, you look adorable.

63
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,880
I can smell Nagisa on it.

64
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,480
Yo. Long time no see.

65
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,940
Who are you?

66
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,480
Hey! We went through this last April!

67
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,280
Sunohara-san. Happy New Year.

68
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,530
Hey, Nagisa-chan. Long time no see.

69
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,030
Whoa!!!

70
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,280
It gets this big, eh?

71
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,200
It's a little embarrassing.

72
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,160
Here.

73
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,170
This is almost mysterious.

74
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,710
That's enough!

75
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,210
Stop being so tactless.

76
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,930
You haven't changed even though
you've become a member of society.

77
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,850
Onee-chan, I don't think you can talk about others.

78
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,010
Kyou. Fujibayashi.

79
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,430
Thanks for coming.

80
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,140
Happy New Year.

81
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,230
I'm here, too.

82
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,060
I came back from America.

83
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,360
Happy New Year, everyone.

84
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,860
Kotomi-chan.

85
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,860
Happy New Year to you, too.

86
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,120
It's really big.

87
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,870
Yes.

88
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,620
May I touch?

89
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,000
Sure.

90
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,580
It's very wonderful.

91
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,800
Me! I'm up next!

92
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,300
Not you.

93
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,880
Why?

94
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,680
The rice cake!

95
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,010
So this is Tomoyo's family, eh?

96
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,810
Her brother looks well, too.

97
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,350
We have one from Miyazawa-san, too.

98
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,440
Looks like everyone is getting along well.

99
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,730
This one is from Nishina-san and Sugisaka-san.

100
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,030
They're saying to do your best to have a healthy baby.

101
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,990
Oh yeah.

102
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,200
Give this to Mei-chan.

103
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,240
What's this?

104
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
Yoshino-san's newest release.

105
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,710
He started singing again as an indie.

106
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,710
"Lobe and Spannier"?

107
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,550
You read that "Love and Spanner".

108
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,670
Did you really graduate from high school?

109
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,180
It's a very distinctive title.

110
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,850
Yoshino-san and I came up with the title.

111
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,180
We got it to sound as normal as we could.

112
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,440
Hey, Okazaki.

113
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,600
What?

114
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,600
Yes?

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,690
Hey, they're both Okazaki now.

116
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,610
Then, Okazaki-guy.

117
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,360
What kinda name is that?

118
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,280
What does it feel like to become a father?

119
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,740
What a strange thing to ask.

120
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm interested in hearing your thoughts, too.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,210
What does it feel like to become a parent?

122
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,590
I thought becoming a parent is something way in the future.

123
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,590
But hearing you two were going to be parents,
it suddenly felt much more "real".

124
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,850
I probably shouldn't say this in front of you two,

125
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,770
but no one becomes a father because they want to.

126
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,730
I consider it more like a natural hazard like earthquake or lightning.

127
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,650
So I want to know what's in your mind
as you become a father.

128
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,910
Beats me.

129
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,320
I don't have a clue.

130
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,830
Are you sure that's all right?

131
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,120
Honestly, I'm not sure if it registers that I'm going to be a father yet.

132
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,130
But, I found a person I can love, and this happened when I lived for her sake.

133
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,590
That's all there is to it.

134
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,130
In the end, Okazaki,

135
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,800
you haven't changed at all.

136
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,220
Yeah?

137
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,300
Yeah.

138
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,930
It felt like you and Nagisa-chan became distant, but you weren't so far away.

139
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,100
Glad I found that out.

140
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,150
Yeah. I was actually nervous until I saw you two.

141
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,820
It felt like you two were way ahead in the life game.

142
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,240
Life is very mysterious.

143
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,030
Where does it come from, and where does it go?

144
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,620
Right now, I'm researching the same thing my father and mother were.

145
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,380
The hidden world, was it?

146
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
Yup.

147
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,930
It's another world that exists right next to this one, but it can't be seen or felt.

148
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,560
But we're starting to find out that's not entirely true.

149
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,230
Really?

150
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,980
Yup.

151
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,400
It's probably akin to a warped extra dimension.

152
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:56,280
The current theory states that what we perceive as objects are stuck firm to high dimension planes...

153
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,660
...and they cannot remove themselves from their maximum existence.

154
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,620
But, for example, energy due to gravity is said to transcend through dimensions.

155
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,290
Just like that-

156
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,370
Stop!

157
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,960
Tell us the story so we can understand.

158
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,260
That was a very, very simplified explanation.

159
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:20,050
So you're saying that this world and the hidden world are related strongly at a deep level?

160
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,260
Yes.

161
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,480
Time, space, and people's minds echo in a strange way...

162
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,150
...to recreate both worlds or create whole new ones.

163
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,020
It might be affecting each other like that.

164
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,730
That's what I wanted to say.

165
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,570
Could our lives be tied to that world, too?

166
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,120
Maybe, then yet again maybe not.

167
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,620
This world is really filled with mystery.

168
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,880
I wonder what the hidden world is like.

169
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,590
What? Why did I just think of that play?

170
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,100
The girl in the world that ended.

171
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,470
Why did I know that story?

172
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,850
Tomoya-kun?

173
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,140
I was just thinking.

174
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,690
In that other world, people might be having parties like us.

175
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,030
There may be more than one hidden world.

176
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,490
There's a theory of multiple worlds existing, too.

177
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Fujibayashi.

178
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,500
I remember you saying something like that when you were talking about fortune telling.

179
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,670
Yes. There is no one future,
but there are many possibilities.

180
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,340
I still think that.

181
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:42,720
Then there could be a world where one of you is dating me, right?

182
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,430
Not a chance with me.

183
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,060
I'd reject you, too!

184
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,900
I can't create anything.

185
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,450
All I can do is pile up the junk.

186
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,780
No matter how much effort I put in, it was useless.

187
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,540
I had stopped working at a certain point.

188
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,760
So you were here, too.

189
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,550
Old man.

190
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,050
The city will continue to change.

191
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,180
Nothing can stay as is.

192
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,270
That's what it means to live.

193
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,150
But isn't this an important place for you?

194
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,570
If I interfered with this construction, would Nagisa be able to stay well?

195
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,030
It's an idea that's crossed my mind.

196
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:53,160
Don't be ridiculous. It's a great thing for the people of this city for this hospital to be built.

197
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,630
It's not something we can mess with.

198
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,130
I'm coming to hate this city.

199
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:06,430
To tell you the truth, I asked people involved with the construction to preserve some trees.

200
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,100
Tomo-pyon did something similar, right?

201
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,180
Tomo-pyon?

202
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,970
Oh, you mean Tomoyo.

203
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,440
I heard you guys decided to deliver at a hospital.

204
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,940
Yeah. It's more reassuring to be in a place where there's equipment.

205
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,940
Walk over, wait, and pray, eh?

206
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,450
We might get some snow.

207
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,250
That night, we were buried with snow.

208
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,710
With neither trains nor cars able to move,
the city froze as if it had gotten sick.

209
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,420
Meanwhile, Nagisa caught a fever,
and the contractions started at the same time.

210
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,100
It was labor two weeks earlier than expected.

211
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,810
Nagisa! Hang in there, Nagisa!

212
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,360
Nagisa...

213
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,910
I'm all right...

214
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,250
I will give birth to Shio-chan.

215
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,250
I will live with you and Shio-chan. The three of us together.

216
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,340
Yagi-san's here.

217
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,010
The cars can't move yet.

218
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,300
Why did this come on a day like this?

219
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,930
Furukawa-san. Please prepare hot water.

220
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,850
As much as possible.

221
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,010
Okay.

222
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,100
Okazaki-san. You keep on supporting your wife.

223
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,730
It's all right to be holding on to her hand, right?

224
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,770
Of course. Please do.

225
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,900
Nagisa. I'm right here.

226
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,280
Don't lose, Nagisa!

227
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,990
You will give birth fine and start a new life, right?

228
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,000
With Ushio, a new life for the three of us.

229
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,370
Don't worry, calm down.

230
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,380
There now, breathe out.

231
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,800
Yes, that's right.

232
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,260
Breathe.

233
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,260
Yes, loosen up.

234
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,100
Yes, good. That's it.

235
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,220
Shall I take a look?

236
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,070
Nagisa passed out multiple times.

237
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,990
And she woke up to the pain.

238
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,120
It was so cruel that I wanted to stop looking.

239
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,800
It was long, and it felt like it was going to continue without end.

240
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,140
Even I felt as though I was going to pass out.

241
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,100
Perhaps, my mind couldn't take any more.

242
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,020
Or perhaps, I despaired over everything.

243
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,880
Nagisa?

244
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,920
Nagisa?

245
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,130
Nagisa...

246
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,930
Nagisa!

247
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,810
Tomoya...kun...

248
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,230
I'm here! I'm right here!

249
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,160
You can hear it, right?

250
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,070
The voice of our child crying?

251
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,660
Yes...

252
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,000
Look. I'm the first one to hug her.

253
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,500
Yes...

254
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,540
She's beautiful.

255
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,340
It's our child.

256
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,920
This is Ushio.

257
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,970
Shio-chan...

258
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,220
It's a girl! It's a lively girl!

259
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,470
Yes...

260
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,270
I'm glad I was able to have her at home.

261
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,940
Though, I made Shio-chan go through extra trouble.

262
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,690
Well done... You've done a great job.

263
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,320
But, I'm a little tired now.

264
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,200
May I rest for a while?

265
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,790
Nagisa!

266
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,290
Damn it! Is the doctor still not here?!

267
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,210
Cars still can't move?!

268
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,250
Nagisa... Hold on, Nagisa.

269
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,760
L-Let's talk for a little more.

270
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,260
You can just listen to me.

271
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,720
Look, it's our child.

272
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,680
She looks like a monkey, doesn't she?

273
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,810
So small, too.

274
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,980
I'm going to call to her now, okay?

275
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,480
Ushio.

276
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,860
I'm your daddy, Ushio.

277
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,780
She's your mommy.

278
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,400
Look.

279
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,990
She ignored me.

280
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,330
Yeah, of course. She doesn't understand what I'm saying.

281
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,380
I'm sure she'll grow fast, enter elementary school.

282
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,050
Then we'd go to the open house and sports day together.

283
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,590
We'll participate as a family.

284
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,100
I used to be the one that scoffed at stuff like that the most.

285
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,650
Nagisa?

286
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Nagisa?

287
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,070
Feel that? It's Ushio's cheek.

288
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,990
Yeah? Feel that?

289
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,920
Nagisa...

290
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,220
You said you'll always be with me, right?

291
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,140
You said you'll always be with me...

292
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,230
We... We promised we will, many times, right?

293
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,310
That's my dream.

294
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,860
"There's nothing good even if I lived."

295
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,400
"It's a boring life."

296
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,450
It's a dream a guy, who used to think things like that, finally found.

297
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,370
Hey... Nagisa.

298
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,660
Nagisa...

299
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,460
Nagisa!

300
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,190
Do you like this school?

301
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,940
I really, really love it.

302
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,150
But nothing can stay unchanged.

303
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,910
Fun things... Happy things...

304
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,580
They can't all possibly stay unchanged.

305
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,330
Even so, can you keep on loving this place?

306
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,970
If only we'd never met...

307
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,640
We should have taken different paths.

308
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,230
I wouldn't have dated Nagisa,
nor would I have married her.

309
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,150
Ushio wouldn't have been born, either.

310
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,730
Then this sadness would never have haunted me.

311
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,710
I should never have met her.
