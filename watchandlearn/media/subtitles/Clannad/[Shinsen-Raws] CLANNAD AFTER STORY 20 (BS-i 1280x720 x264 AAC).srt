2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,220
Your teacher comes back today, right?

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,180
Ya.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,320
I see. Then I'd better say hello.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,380
Should we leave a little earlier than usual?

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,480
Okay.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,540
It's good.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,840
All right.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,070
Let's get a move on, shall we?

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,330
Ya!

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,940
Ushio, say "I'm going" to Mommy.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,760
I'm going.

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,520
We're going.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,270
Hey, Ushio!

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,540
It's dangerous, so wait!

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:00:59,900
Ushio!

17
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,810
Stew!

18
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,270
Stew!

19
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,060
Gof! Gof!

20
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,600
What is that?

21
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,020
The kindergarten pet.

22
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,440
Stew.

23
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,150
Why a boar?

24
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,690
No, it can't be.

25
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,570
You must be Okazaki Ushio-chan's father.

26
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,660
Y-You!

27
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,540
I'm Ushio-chan's teacher, Fujibayashi Kyou.

28
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,330
Pleased to meet you.

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,040
Yes, the pleasure is mine.

30
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,720
This is the first time I've ever seen a face like that on you.

31
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,260
Why you!

32
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,140
You should have known
the moment you saw Botan.

33
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,480
Or have you forgotten about me already?

34
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,320
So that is Botan.

35
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,900
Gof!

36
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,820
Ushio-chan, to tell you the truth,
your daddy and I went to school together.

37
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,410
She was violent back then.

38
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,870
She always bullied me.

39
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,460
Hey! Don't make stories up!

40
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,000
She was also a good friend of Mommy's.

41
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,880
Did you know that?

42
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:10,350
Sanae-san came and said that you'd eventually come, so not to tell the whole story until then.

43
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,060
I see... Sanae-san did.

44
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,280
Fate is pretty strange.

45
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,740
Whoever thought I'd be Ushio-chan's teacher?

46
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,030
I must have made you worry a lot.

47
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,410
Sorry.

48
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,790
It must have been hard.

49
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,210
Yeah.

50
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,340
Ryou, Kotomi, and Youhei are all worried about you.

51
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,300
We were thinking maybe we should visit you when we got together over New Years, but...

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,010
We ended up saying it'd be best to leave you alone for now.

53
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,890
Thanks.

54
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,520
But this means that everything's settled, right?

55
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,560
All the loose ends?

56
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,770
Yeah.

57
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,690
How's Ushio doing?

58
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,240
Is she getting along with everyone?

59
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,150
She's a really good girl.

60
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,700
She's not cynical like you.

61
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,740
I bet she got it from her mother.

62
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,500
But I'd say she's more active than her mother was.

63
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,880
She runs off on her own when I take my eyes off her, so I'm extra careful.

64
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,420
Really?

65
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,840
Good morning.

66
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,340
Good morning!

67
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,050
Good morning, Sensei!

68
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,470
Good morning, Takuya-kun.

69
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,510
I'll get going now.

70
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,930
I'll leave Ushio with you.

71
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,310
If anything happens, call me.

72
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,560
I'll help you out.

73
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,980
Yeah, I'll be relying on you, Fujibayashi-sensei.

74
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,400
Ushio-chan!

75
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,700
Your daddy's heading to work!

76
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,660
Have a good day, Daddy.

77
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,960
Yeah, off I go.

78
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,380
Aren't you glad that you can live with your daddy?

79
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,630
Yup!

80
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,390
All right, shall we go inside?

81
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,050
Yup.

82
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,310
Fuko-chan is?

83
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,020
Yeah. She wants to visit your place.

84
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,110
Do you have any plans this coming Sunday?

85
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,360
No, nothing really.

86
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,820
But why?

87
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,280
Apparently she wants to become friends with Ushio-chan.

88
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,950
It'd help if you would let her.

89
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,450
Fuko-chan just got out of hospital and needs to practice walking on her own.

90
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,790
Oh, I see. She's going through rehab.

91
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,420
She's also shy around people.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,800
It's rare that she actively wants to meet someone.

93
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,720
I want to create such opportunities for her.

94
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,220
Okay.

95
00:06:51,720 --> 00:07:13,200
涙がこぼれ落ちるのは何のせい

96
00:06:51,720 --> 00:07:13,200
What causes my tears to fall?

97
00:06:51,720 --> 00:07:13,200
Namida ga kobore ochiru noha nan no sei

98
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,810
It looks like Ushio likes Fuko-chan, as well.

99
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,100
We'll be expecting her.

100
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,430
Sorry about this.

101
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,560
And thank you.

102
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,690
It's nothing.

103
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:24,750
重ねすぎた歳のせい

104
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:24,750
It's from living for too long.

105
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:24,750
Kasane sugita toshi no sei

106
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:37,220
椅子に揺られて夢を見ていたんだ

107
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:37,220
Isu ni yurarete yume wo mite itanda

108
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:37,220
I was having a dream, sitting in a rocking chair,

109
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:49,360
あなたが小さな祝福の中で生まれてきた日の

110
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:49,360
Anata ga chiisana shukufuku no nakade umarete kita hi no

111
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:49,360
Of sunlight peaking past branches and of the happy day

112
00:07:49,030 --> 00:08:02,500
木漏れ日を　幸せな日を

113
00:07:49,030 --> 00:08:02,500
Komorebi wo shiawase na hi wo

114
00:07:49,030 --> 00:08:02,500
When you were born surrounded by blessings.

115
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,390
Oh yeah, Ushio. You're going to have a guest tomorrow.

116
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,600
Guest?

117
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,060
Ibuki Fuko-chan.

118
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,810
You remember her, right?

119
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,980
I do.

120
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,270
She said she wants to play with you.

121
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,610
Is that all right?

122
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,570
Yup. I'm happy.

123
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,320
You're happy about it?

124
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,610
Yup. I'm happy.

125
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,200
Daddy. Can you sing Mommy's song?

126
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,460
Again? You really like it, don't you?

127
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,340
Yup. It's my favorite.

128
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,470
All right. But it's nighttime, so quietly, okay?

129
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,600
Dango, dango, dango, dango...

130
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,850
A great big dango family!

131
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:15,700
A mischievous roasted dango, a kind sweet bean dango

132
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:15,700
ヤンチャな焼きだんご　優しいあんだんご

133
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:15,700
Yancha na yaki dango yasashii an dango

134
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:15,700
PLACEHOLDER

135
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:15,280
A mischievous roasted dango, a kind, sweet bean dango...

136
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:24,040
Gather them all up and it’s a family of a hundred.

137
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:24,040
Minna, minna, awasete hyakunin kazoku

138
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:24,040
みんな、みんな、合わせて１００人家族

139
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:33,670
赤ちゃんだんごはいつも幸せの中で

140
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:33,670
A baby dango is always cradled in happiness.

141
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:33,670
Akachan dango ha itsumo shiawase no naka de

142
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:42,890
An old dango gazes with squinty eyes.

143
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:42,890
Toshiyori dango ha me wo hosometeru

144
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:42,890
年寄りだんごは目を細めてる

145
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:52,940
Nakayoshi dango te wo tsunagi ookina marui wa ni naruyo

146
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:52,940
The dango friends will all hold hands and form a big circle.

147
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:52,940
仲良しだんご手を繋ぎ　大きな丸い輪になるよ

148
00:09:53,020 --> 00:10:02,660
町を作りだんご星の上　みんなで笑いあうよ

149
00:09:53,020 --> 00:10:02,660
Machi wo tsukuri dango boshi no ue minna de warai auyo

150
00:09:53,020 --> 00:10:02,660
They’ll found a village on a dango planet and all smile together.

151
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:12,000
The rabbits are waving their hands from the big moon.

152
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:12,000
ウサギも空で手を振って見てる　でっかいお月さま

153
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:12,000
Usagi mo sora de te wo futte miteru dekkai otsuki-sama

154
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:22,390
Ureshii koto kanashii koto mo zenbu marumete

155
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:22,390
Roll up all the happy and sad things...

156
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:22,390
うれしいこと　かなしいことも全部丸めて

157
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,980
Fuko's here for a visit.

158
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,860
Thank you for having Fuko over.

159
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,400
Yeah, welcome.

160
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,940
Now, right off the bat, Ushio-chan.

161
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,320
Be Fuko's little sister!

162
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,570
No, she won't!

163
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,660
Fuko isn't talking to you.
Fuko's talking with Ushio-chan.

164
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,750
Ushio-chan. Don't you like Fuko?

165
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:53,790
I do.

166
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,340
How's that?

167
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,880
But I'm staying with Daddy.

168
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,800
Hear that?

169
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,600
Then Fuko will spend today to win you over.

170
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,850
First, this is the gift for us getting to know each other!

171
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,690
It's a made-to-order bread by Furukawa-san.

172
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,730
Will you eat it, Ushio-chan?

173
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,610
I will.

174
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,910
It's a pretty cute design coming from you.

175
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,870
Itadakimasu.

176
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,290
It's good.

177
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,340
Cute Ushio-chan is eating cute bread, and her cuteness just doubled!

178
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,210
Don't hug her for every reason you make up!

179
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,800
We're having lunch now.
Do you want to eat with us?

180
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,640
Are you trying to win Fuko over?

181
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,260
No way!

182
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,650
Fuko heard that you lost your wife, Okazaki-san.

183
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,770
So?

184
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,820
It's no surprise that you see a sliver of her in Fuko.

185
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,150
Let me tell you something.

186
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,030
Please.

187
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,950
Nagisa doesn't resemble you at all; almost like a separate species.

188
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,410
You had an alien as your wife?!

189
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,710
I'm saying you are!

190
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,790
Fuko's not an alien!

191
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,710
I can't follow your thought process.

192
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,960
Fuko has an average Earthling's thought process.

193
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,880
Neighbors often say that
Fuko is a very average Earthling.

194
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,300
What kind of neighbors do you have?!

195
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,560
Therefore, let's go home together!

196
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,600
That doesn't follow at all!

197
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,190
Besides, if you represent the average Earthling's thought process,

198
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,480
the world would be gone in three days.

199
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,360
Fuko cannot understand your statement at all.

200
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,660
What would you do if there's a button in front of you that says "don't press"?

201
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,990
Fuko will hide and press it secretly.

202
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,290
That was the launch button of the nuke.

203
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,370
That was not fair! You tricked Fuko!

204
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,210
The Earth would be gone in less than three days.

205
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,170
Then here's a question for you, too.

206
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:06,380
What would you do if tights that say
"don't wear" were lying on the ground?

207
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,050
I'd leave them alone.

208
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:13,350
You're lying! Fuko's sure that, not being able to control yourself, you'd put them on!

209
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,230
Okazaki's the best!

210
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,280
The world would end because of you.

211
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:30,160
It's late now, but you didn't add any sleeping pills, did you?

212
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,620
Even if you were sleeping your butt off, I wouldn't touch you with a six-foot pole, so don't worry.

213
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,920
D-Does that mean you care about Fuko that much?

214
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,170
Heck no.

215
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,840
You don't have to hide.

216
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,760
Who says?!

217
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,550
You.

218
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,800
Damn you...

219
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,930
Enough! I won't talk with you anymore!

220
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,100
Are you embarrassed?

221
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,890
And so, let's play cards.

222
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,560
Ushio-chan, do you know how to play blackjack or gin rummy?

223
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,020
Hey. You're talking to a five year old.

224
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:10,530
Sorry. Fuko's an adult,
so Fuko suggested advanced games.

225
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,580
Do you know any games, Ushio?

226
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,370
Sevens!

227
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,630
Ushio-chan, best choice!

228
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,550
That is an addictive game!

229
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,170
You're such a kid.

230
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,050
Okazaki-san. You're holding on to the ten of hearts, aren't you?

231
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,300
Well, since I still have lots of card I can play.

232
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,890
You're up, Ushio.

233
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,680
Here!

234
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,890
That was great, Ushio-chan!

235
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,560
Now Fuko's back in the game.

236
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,360
Damn, when I had her cornered in well.

237
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,530
Just from that one move, we can tell that Ushio-chan loves Fuko more than you.

238
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,660
Of course not!

239
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
In your face.

240
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,620
If you were alive...

241
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,850
Okazaki-san. Okazaki-san.

242
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,140
Sorry. It was my turn, right?

243
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,480
So you do see a sliver
of your wife in Fuko after all.

244
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,530
I said that wouldn't happen.

245
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,030
Perhaps our personalities are different?

246
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,070
Maybe your wife was a childish person?

247
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,580
I can't name a person more childish than you.

248
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,500
You've never met your mother, right?

249
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,370
No. She only knows her face from pictures.

250
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,300
But I heard stories from Daddy.

251
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,670
What kind of person was your Mommy?

252
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,590
Ah...

253
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,850
A big crybaby.

254
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,850
But a person who did
her best to give birth to me.

255
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,320
And, the person Daddy really loved!

256
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,740
Um...

257
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,950
Sorry.

258
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,910
She just comes back to me at times.

259
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,420
Fuko has free time, so call whenever you want.

260
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,170
Fuko will come whenever you do.

261
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,670
Fuko will do whatever Fuko can.

262
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,720
Are you trying to be nice?

263
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,560
It's not like that; Fuko just wants to play with Ushio-chan.

264
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,930
Oh, I see.

265
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,810
Fuko will be heading home now!

266
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,860
Just say bye.

267
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,320
Let's go, Ushio-chan.

268
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,190
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

269
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,820
Oh well. There will be plenty of opportunities in the future.

270
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,910
Be careful when you go to bed.

271
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,330
Fuko will say hi when Fuko sees you on the street.

272
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:09,500
Fuko has memorized Ushio-chan's scent, so Fuko can tell when she's nearby.

273
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,710
Are you an animal?

274
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,380
When it happens, let's play together.

275
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,510
Yup.

276
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,760
Good bye.

277
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,520
Yup. Bye bye.

278
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,190
I'm tired.

279
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,150
She was funny.

280
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,360
Yeah, that's very true.

281
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,320
Let's clean up and take a bath, yeah?

282
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,780
Yup.

283
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,210
Botan doesn't get angry over that?

284
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,840
I think she takes it as a back rub and likes it.

285
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
Gof, gof.

286
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,640
Ushio-chan! Good-for-nothing's here for you!

287
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,770
Welcome back!

288
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,060
Sorry I made you wait.

289
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,060
Wow, you totally have the doting parent look on your face.

290
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,900
Ushio-chan, what should we do with your pathetic daddy?

291
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,820
Daddy's cool.

292
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,200
She has good eyes for spotting men.

293
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,460
I gave Ushio-chan a handout for the sports day, so read it, all right?

294
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,370
Sports day?

295
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:33,540
Yeah. There are family events, too, so you'd better practice.

296
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,920
I knew about the sports day.

297
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,050
The head of the neighborhood committee told me about it.

298
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,720
Then will you come cheer for her?

299
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,510
Yes.

300
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,470
But rather than cheering...

301
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,020
Akki!

302
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,020
Hey Ushio. I didn't know you were here.

303
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,690
What's with that outfit?

304
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,530
Jogging in preparation for the sports day, of course.

305
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,320
I can't stay still.

306
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,870
That's not in the program.

307
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,740
Akio-san is a fast runner,

308
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:11,750
so he's asked to be anchor for the teacher team in place of the principal, who has a bad waist.

309
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,420
You'll be on the parent team, right?

310
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,000
It's a showdown between us.

311
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,630
That's a very exciting situation!

312
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,170
Hold on one minute please!

313
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,680
I haven't decided to be in the relay yet.

314
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,510
Sanae, tell the principal that he'll run the parent team's anchor.

315
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,720
I will.

316
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,640
They're so forceful.

317
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,940
Daddy.

318
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,310
Good luck.

319
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,070
All right! Daddy's gonna do his best!

320
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,440
Do his best!

321
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,280
What are you doing?

322
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,160
I can't look pathetic when my daughter's watching.

323
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,050
Ushio-chan!

324
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,310
Fuko Onee-chan.

325
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,310
So you like to go on strolls?

326
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,310
Yup.

327
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,520
You're not scared of getting lost?

328
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,190
Lost?

329
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:27,070
It's like you don't know which way to go, and
you feel unsure, are in trouble, and can't move.

330
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,160
You're not scared of that?

331
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,330
Nope.

332
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,000
You're amazing.

333
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,370
Fuko should learn that from you.

334
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,420
But Fuko thinks it's dangerous for little girls to walk outside alone.

335
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,840
Ushio-chan, where are you going?

336
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,560
It's the new hospital.

337
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,270
Do you like it here?

338
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,020
Yup.

339
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,690
Why?

340
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,070
Just because.

341
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,610
Just because, is it?

342
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,270
Tomorrow's finally the day.

343
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,530
Yeah! The day I show you who's boss!

344
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,290
Ushio. We can hardly wait for tomorrow to come, can we?

345
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,000
What's wrong, Ushio?

346
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,630
I couldn't pee alone.

347
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,760
What's wrong, Ushio?!

348
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,800
She's burning up.

349
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,240
I'm...

350
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:58,490
My family might just be getting toyed with by this city.

351
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,290
Given happiness, then having it snatched away.

352
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,470
I can't even grant the one wish my only daughter has?

353
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,930
Nagisa...

354
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,310
What should I do?
