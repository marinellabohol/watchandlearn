00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,900
I lived only because I was alive.

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,910
Wake up, go to work, eat, sleep.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,670
Just repeating the routines drilled into my body.

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,710
That was my "life".

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,180
I worked like I was punishing my body.

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,930
I worked without thinking,
wanting to forget everything.

8
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,190
Okazaki-kun, why don't you call it a day?

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm almost done with this.

10
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:59,230
It's great you're working hard,
but you'll break down if you keep this up.

11
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,090
You haven't even taken a break this summer yet, have you?

12
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,210
It's no problem. I'm doing this because I enjoy doing it.

13
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,080
If you don't take some time off,
I'll get yelled at by the government, you know?

14
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,980
After work and day offs were torture.

15
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,200
I used money to waste time.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,430
Taking a look at the reality, and it felt like things would break down from the ground up.

17
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,190
I hate this city.

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,700
But there isn't anything
I can do to leave this city.

19
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,410
I lived so I didn't have to think about anything.

20
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,210
I didn't want to think about anything.

21
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,240
I wanted to remain oblivious to everything.

22
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,120
I thought of everything as a mistake.

23
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,300
The fact that I met her.

24
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,200
The fact that I dated and married her.

25
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,420
And the fact that I had a child with her.

26
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,160
All of those were mistakes.

27
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:26,490
If junk only takes shape by wishing from one's heart, then I couldn't do it alone.

28
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,580
I already knew that.

29
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,870
Because...

30
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,870
Because I'm...

31
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,210
...not human.

32
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,640
Are you crying?

33
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,770
Did you remember something sad?

34
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,900
It's this world that's sad, isn't it?

35
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,860
This place will soon be completely white.

36
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,620
If I can't move, then you'll become alone, won't you?

37
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,890
Yes?

38
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,440
Hello, Tomoya-san.

39
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,820
Sanae-san!

40
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,530
I'm sorry. Were you still asleep?

41
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,900
No, it's all right.

42
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,650
Are you alone?

43
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,160
Yes. I came alone.

44
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,830
Will you give me a moment?

45
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,160
It's really messy, so I'll clean up.

46
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,800
It's a very hot day, isn't it?

47
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,010
Yes.

48
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,760
You have to step outside once in a while to refresh yourself.

49
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,760
Yes. Yoshino-san says that often.

50
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,140
But, going out alone on a hot day like this...

51
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,520
Then come on a date with me.

52
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,270
Huh?

53
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,110
What's this about all of a sudden?

54
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,530
Nothing in particular.

55
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,780
I just want to go on a date with young people once in a while.

56
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,870
Then why don't you find someone besides me?

57
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,330
I won't do that.

58
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,960
You're very handsome and kind;
you fit my likings.

59
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,250
That's not true. I'm always spoiled by you.

60
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,970
This place has changed a lot.

61
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,720
You don't come to the train station often?

62
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,930
No, not this side of the station.

63
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,690
Can you take an extended vacation this summer?

64
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,700
I'm being hassled to take one by the company.

65
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,120
Then how about we go somewhere?

66
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,780
Just us two?

67
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,620
That'd be pretty exciting.

68
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,540
That would be good, too.

69
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,620
But this time, let's all go together.

70
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
"All?"

71
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,340
Yes. All together.

72
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,010
Mom! Hurry! Let's get some drinks!

73
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,510
Stop that. You'll trouble the other customers.

74
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,270
Let's go. Akio-san's been wanting to have a drink with you, too.

75
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,150
But I'm...

76
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,400
Let's go.

77
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,940
Yeah?

78
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,320
I'll think about it.

79
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,370
This is Sanae.

80
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,750
Have you decided about going on a trip?

81
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,500
Ah, no. I haven't thought about it yet.

82
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,250
Then I'll call back later.

83
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,090
Why is she so forceful?

84
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,840
Hello?

85
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,010
Have you given it some thought?

86
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,930
You win.

87
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,310
Then you'll go?

88
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,980
Yes.

89
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,190
I'll ask for a break towards the end of the week so I'll get four days off including Sunday.

90
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,940
Thank you very much.

91
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,830
To be honest, I was at a loss.

92
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:47,000
But it felt like saying "no" to her now would be betraying her.

93
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,420
After all, I've forced everything onto her.

94
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,640
Hello.

95
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,060
Sanae-san?

96
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,940
Old man!

97
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,370
To Tomoya-san.

98
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,960
Something came up,
so I must leave with Akio-san.

99
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,970
I'll leave the rest to you.

100
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,180
You're kidding me.

101
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,960
Nagisa...

102
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,230
Ushio!

103
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,060
Hey now, you don't have to be so nervous. Come out.

104
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,940
Sanae-san and the old man went out, eh?

105
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,520
What do you want to do?

106
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,110
Sanae-san.

107
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,070
No, listen. Sanae-san's not here.

108
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,990
Akki.

109
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,700
The old man's not here, either.

110
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,120
They both left without a word to you?

111
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,300
What do you want to do?

112
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,590
I wanna go on the trip.

113
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,630
That's impossible.

114
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,010
Neither Sanae-san nor the old man are here.

115
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,310
Or what? Do you want to go alone?

116
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,640
I wanna go with Sanae-san and Akki.

117
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,770
I told you, that's impossible.

118
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,450
What's with this situation?

119
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,550
For these last five years, I left Ushio with Sanae-san and the old man.

120
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,800
I ignored her entry into kindergarten and the Seven-Five-Three Festival, and worked.

121
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,800
Note: The Seven-Five-Three Festivals celebrate children's growth when they reached the ages seven, five, and three.

122
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:34,390
Sanae-san brought Ushio to my place from time to time, but I hardly looked at her face.

123
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,770
Ushio.

124
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,990
You think you're hiding?

125
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,950
I can totally see you.

126
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,120
Stop standing there and come here.

127
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,670
Sit down.

128
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,170
Whatever.

129
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,470
Let's see. I think both Sanae-san and
the old man will come back by tonight.

130
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,640
So be a good girl and wait.

131
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,390
Okay?

132
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,480
Trip.

133
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,110
We can go once the old man and Sanae-san come back.

134
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,480
Play around yourself for today.

135
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,490
Okay.

136
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,360
She's like a boy.

137
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,410
Ushio!

138
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,290
Are you all right?

139
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,840
It because you run like that.

140
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,670
Does it hurt anywhere?

141
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,800
Looks like you're fine.

142
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,970
Watch out from now on.

143
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,900
You were playing with that?

144
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,570
And it broke when you dropped it, eh?

145
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,540
Poor turtle.

146
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,750
Maybe some superglue will fix him.

147
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,800
Give me a minute. I'll put him back together.

148
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,280
You can still see the crack a little, but it shouldn't be too obvious.

149
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,280
Don't play with him until he dries.

150
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,410
Or else the wheels will stick.

151
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,330
Did she understand what I said?

152
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,660
Oh well.

153
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,470
What?

154
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,630
He won't move.

155
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,680
Hey, now.

156
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
I told you not to move him until he dried, didn't I?

157
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,730
The wheel's not going to move anymore.

158
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,320
Can't fix him anymore?

159
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,400
Not anymore.

160
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,570
Give up.

161
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,650
Do you want to throw him away?

162
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,990
I'm just joking.

163
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,170
Do you still need something?

164
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,170
Sanae-san.

165
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,670
So they're back?

166
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,970
Not back yet.

167
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,010
Oh.

168
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,520
I'm hungry.

169
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,190
I guess I'll go buy something.

170
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,020
Do you have anything you want to eat?

171
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
If not, I'll go buy stuff randomly.

172
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,790
Why, Okazaki-san. Long time no see.

173
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,330
Ah, hello.

174
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,750
How nice, Ushio-chan.
Shopping with your dad today?

175
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,290
Since when...

176
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,380
You're living separately from her, right?

177
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:36,300
I can imagine. Raising a small child alone as a man is difficult.

178
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,970
Oh, but you do see her from time to time, right?

179
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,350
Yes, once in a while.

180
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,730
I'm sure it must be lonely for her not to be able to see you.

181
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,980
After all, you're family.

182
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,820
Y-You're right.

183
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,990
Bye bye, Ushio-chan.

184
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,510
There, eat up.

185
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,140
What's wrong? You can eat by yourself, can't you?

186
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,810
Itadakimasu.

187
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,240
It's bitter.

188
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,530
Bitter?

189
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,330
Oh, the pepper.

190
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Sorry, but it's not a fried rice without it.

191
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,210
Suck it up and eat.

192
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,340
I don't want it.

193
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,840
Hey. Sanae-san told you not to be picky, didn't she?

194
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,390
I want to eat Sanae-san's food.

195
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,890
Then don't eat.

196
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,280
Will it be all right if there's no pepper in it?

197
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,110
Yup.

198
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,160
But it'll taste bad without it.

199
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,360
Rice.

200
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,700
Rice?

201
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,370
You'll eat just rice?

202
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,080
Yup.

203
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,210
Sure, that's easy for me, but...

204
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,410
There.

205
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,630
Rice with fried rice as a side, eh?

206
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,130
Bye.

207
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,300
Hey, what's that for?

208
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,340
Just this.

209
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,640
It looks like I'm abusing you if there's no side dish.

210
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,990
Rice seasoning, eh?

211
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,950
Itadakimasu.

212
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,380
Maybe they're not coming home today.

213
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,740
You're up.

214
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,240
Pee.

215
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,990
Go ahead.

216
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,250
I did it myself.

217
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,840
Of course you did.

218
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,390
Let's swim a lot, okay?

219
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,100
Yeah!

220
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,020
Um...

221
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,070
What?

222
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,610
Poop.

223
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,820
Go ahead.

224
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,510
I did it myself.

225
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,720
Don't brag about it.

226
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,590
I can do it myself, too.

227
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,900
Do you want to go on a trip?

228
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,100
I do.

229
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,110
Then how about just the two of us?

230
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,610
Yup.

231
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,490
You sure? It'll just be me.

232
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,320
Neither Sanae-san nor
the old man will be with us.

233
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,370
But they're not coming.

234
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,460
Yeah. They're not coming, are they?

235
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,160
Yup.

236
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,880
Then let's go.

237
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,420
Yup!

238
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,560
You got everything?

239
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,310
Yup.

240
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,310
Locked everything up?

241
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,180
Yup.

242
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,060
Okay. Let's go!

243
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
Go!

244
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,660
Before today, either Sanae-san or the old man were always there whenever I saw Ushio.

245
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:59,080
This is the first time for us to be alone since she was born.

246
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,470
Where are we headed to?

247
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,890
To Be Continued

248
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,660
Keep it down!

249
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,450
Think about those around you a little!

250
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,490
Mom...

251
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,040
Yes.

252
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,170
Hey. If you're going to the bathroom, say something.

253
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,330
What's wrong?
