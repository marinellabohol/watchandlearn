2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,300
Shima-kun.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,650
Saki-san. Yuki-san.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,970
If you're waiting for Misae, she'll be absent today.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,700
She called Saki this morning.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,850
She said she caught a cold
and so she'll be absent from school.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,420
I see...

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,760
So something did happen.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,980
It's unreal that Misae would skip school.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,900
Could it be that Igarashi-kun told her...

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,320
I see. So she got rejected.

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,520
Poor Misae.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,310
But hey, Shima-kun.

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:47,300
I think a boy like you is a better match for Misae than Igarashi-kun.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,730
Comfort Misae for us.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,380
I'll call her out to the park later.

17
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,320
Sagara-san.

18
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,750
Sh-Shima-kun. Why are you here?

19
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,570
Um, Sagara-sa... I mean...

20
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,200
Misae-san.

21
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,890
What?

22
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,220
Love is like a firework from the past.

23
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,590
What does that mean?

24
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,050
It's more beautiful for it to go to pieces and scatter far off.

25
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,510
Are you picking a fight with me?!

26
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,890
I'm sorry!

27
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,230
Use this.

28
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,560
I'm not crying.

29
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,270
Then in case you don't find paper in the bathroom...

30
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,770
Are you being considerate or inconsiderate?!

31
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,420
You're speaking complete nonsense.

32
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,620
I bet Yuki and Saki told you to say all that.

33
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,240
You can tell?

34
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,250
You would never say stuff like that.

35
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,360
Why don't you say something original?

36
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,460
Well...

37
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,960
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,380
Why are you apologizing?

39
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,600
Probably... because I feel I'm responsible for the situation.

40
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,630
What are you talking about? You have nothing to...

41
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,400
Thinking back, I think there's a ton of stuff...

42
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,260
I'm really sorry!

43
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,880
But really, the reason I'm depressed is because of something else.

44
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,990
It's not your fault.

45
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,770
Really?

46
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,600
Are you thinking this is your chance to have me fall for you?

47
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,750
Like I said it would be, yesterday?

48
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,130
I wasn't thinking of something like that.

49
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:52,850
Of course. You only came to return the favor; it's not like you love me.

50
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,240
That's not true!

51
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,050
Really?

52
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,280
So, you do like me.

53
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,610
Yeah.

54
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,500
I... see...

55
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,010
So hey. What do you like about me?

56
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,160
Things like you yelling at me and worrying about me.

57
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,560
Also, whenever you put me in a wrestling hold, I can smell your good scent...

58
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,840
...and I like that.

59
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,180
I don't think that last one was necessary.

60
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,890
I'm sorry!

61
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,530
Forget about apologizing.

62
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,750
Okay.

63
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,740
Um...

64
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,010
Thank you.

65
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,780
Um... You're welcome.

66
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,740
Misae!

67
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,070
Do you have time today?

68
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,410
There's a new ice cream shop on the other side of the station!

69
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,080
Sorry. Today's... See?

70
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,090
He's waiting and all, so I'd feel bad if I didn't accompany him.

71
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,980
Bye.

72
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,010
I guess things are going well for them.

73
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,980
She looks so happy.

74
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,230
Student Council President?

75
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:25,860
Yup. Believe it or not, I'm the school's first female Student Council President.

76
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,010
Wow, you're amazing.

77
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,370
The Autumn Festival is coming up soon, right?

78
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,450
Our school's helping out with it, too,
so things are a little busy.

79
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,080
Autumn Festival?

80
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,800
So...

81
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,680
...if you don't have any plans on that day...

82
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,210
...would you want to go with me?

83
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,570
To the Autumn Festival.

84
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,090
I'll be discovered... I'm sure of it.

85
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,530
Don't worry. You look good.

86
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,810
I see. So Misae-san's busy.

87
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,480
Yes. She's attending a Student Council meeting.

88
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,420
She wanted us to tell you that she'll be out late.

89
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,510
I want to see her working.

90
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,830
Actually, he looks so cute
it's starting to make me angry.

91
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,390
I'll deliver this love quietly to you.

92
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,240
That's Yoshino-senpai.

93
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,110
He's as popular as usual.

94
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,930
Hey you. Which class are you in?

95
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,720
I haven't seen you around.
Are you a transfer student?

96
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,520
Want me to give you a tour of the school?

97
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,050
That's fine. We're taking her around.

98
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,710
Please don't worry.

99
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,330
No need for modesty.

100
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,030
I'm not trying to flirt with her or anything.

101
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,810
We're really fine, thank you.

102
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,070
Go on, Shima-kun.

103
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,810
Then at least tell me her name.

104
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,950
No, it's really all right...

105
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,500
Hey, wait you!

106
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,700
I said wait!

107
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,720
Moving on to the next topic.

108
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,080
Regarding the student who brings in guitars and has live concerts in class.

109
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,420
There's no problem with singing, but it shouldn't be done in class.

110
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,420
She's so cool.

111
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,720
Do you need something in the Student Council room?

112
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,140
If there's something you need in there, go on in.

113
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,240
It's not as though it was off limits.

114
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,980
No, I'm...

115
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,850
And so...

116
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,090
Sagara-san.

117
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,270
Ibuki-sensei.

118
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,570
Sorry to bother you in the middle of your meeting.

119
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,650
It seems like she has something to say.

120
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,240
What's the matter?

121
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,920
Wow, she's really cute.

122
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,830
I didn't know we had a girl like this at our school.

123
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Th-Thank you very much.

124
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,500
You have something you want to tell me?

125
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,020
Say what's on your mind.

126
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,620
It's the Student Council's job
to listen to the students' opinions.

127
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,220
Um!

128
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,690
I...

129
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,890
I want you to be with me forever.

130
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,130
Um... What relationship do the two of you have?

131
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,480
I'm sorry!

132
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,300
That was hilarious!

133
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,560
It's not a laughing matter.

134
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,250
Maybe she figured out that it was me.

135
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,410
Don't worry.

136
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,930
Misae might like you more in that outfit.

137
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,970
How could that be true?

138
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,470
Right...

139
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,430
I had forgotten.

140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,570
Hey, Shima-kun. Are you busy after this?

141
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,170
We were just saying that we should go visit your place after this.

142
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,340
Oh, so Misae hasn't been to your place yet?

143
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,950
This sense of superiority from visiting the home before the girlfriend...

144
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,510
Let's brag to Misae later.

145
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,450
What's wrong?

146
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,310
You don't feel like it after all?

147
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,470
No, it's not like that.

148
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,930
I can't remember...

149
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,430
...where my home is.

150
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,940
Hey, it's right here.

151
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,150
Don't scare us with a joke like that.

152
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,610
May I help you?

153
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,150
Hello!

154
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,640
What's wrong? Say, "I'm home."

155
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,670
Are you Katsuki's friends?

156
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,540
Yes.

157
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,020
Well, thank you for coming.

158
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,800
Please come in and offer incense for him.

159
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,300
That's right...

160
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,170
I remember now...

161
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,810
The real Shima Katsuki is no longer here.

162
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,320
I'm... I'm not actually Shima Katsuki.

163
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:22,980
Hey!

164
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,490
Wait!

165
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,960
Hey, what's the meaning of this?

166
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,230
There's a story behind this, right?

167
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,880
Is there anything we can do for you?

168
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,310
Then at least remember this.

169
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,650
We believe in you.

170
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,860
Because to us, you are Shima-kun.

171
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,230
No matter what happens, we are your friends.

172
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,260
Thank you.

173
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,540
We'll keep this from Misae.

174
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,140
If there's something you have to tell her,
make sure you let her know.

175
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,660
Okay.

176
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,600
I finally remembered.

177
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,780
I'm not Shima Katsuki.

178
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,650
That was the name of the person dearest to me.

179
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:39,770
We spent much time together,
and he left me with his last wish.

180
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,470
I came to grant that wish.

181
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,410
You're finally here.

182
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,790
I'm sorry I'm late.

183
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,250
It's fine, since I'm always
the one making you wait.

184
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,810
The girl from yesterday was you, wasn't it?

185
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,580
So you knew?

186
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,120
Of course. We see each other every day.

187
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,330
I'm sorry. Was I a bother?

188
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,400
It's fine. I bet it was Yuki and Saki who made you do it, right?

189
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,820
Wish?

190
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,950
Yes. Since that's why I came here.

191
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,620
See? There's a light that grants a wish in here.

192
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,260
What? It's not here.

193
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,720
Maybe there was nothing there to begin with.

194
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,370
If not, it means that it's not necessary for me right now.

195
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,140
What's important is for us to be happy right now.

196
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,310
But this is important, too.

197
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,010
Even if you say that...

198
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,930
I know.

199
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,400
You have a wish in mind?

200
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,360
Yup.

201
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,650
So here's the wish you so wanted to hear.

202
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,780
Please...

203
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,290
...love me forever and ever.

204
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:21,840
Please continue to love me forever and ever.

205
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,960
That's what I wish for.

206
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,630
Sorry. Did I surprise you?

207
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,820
Looks like I really did love her.

208
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:55,470
Though it was only for a short period of time, the time we spent together was precious.

209
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,100
I liked Yuki-san and Saki-san, too.

210
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,040
I loved the time we spent together.

211
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,420
It was supposed to be a copy of what you said to me yesterday.

212
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,020
Gosh, why are you crying?

213
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,230
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,020
You're really one of those people who can't be left alone.

215
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,260
Misae-san.

216
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,790
Thank you...

217
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,280
Thank you so much.

218
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,740
I-I'll go buy something to drink.

219
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,240
Wait right here.

220
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,640
Shima-kun?

221
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,980
Shima-kun!

222
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,840
Shima-ku-

223
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,200
What?

224
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,110
What did you say?

225
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Shima-kun!

226
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,910
Farewell, Misae-san.

227
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,500
I will continue to love you forever.

228
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,780
Forever and ever.

229
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,420
Yep, I'm back here.

230
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,540
Yeah, the boy's dormitory.

231
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,780
No plans for anything like that at the moment.

232
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,310
It's not that I can't forget him.

233
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,740
I guess that's how my life works.

234
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,960
Yeah, let's all meet up soon.

235
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,770
With Yuki, too.

236
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,400
Bye.

237
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,230
You decided to make this your home, eh?

238
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,300
You like being with me that much?

239
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,860
I don't particularly like cats, you know?

240
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,700
That was stupid. Why am I thinking of a fairytale-like thing?

241
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,750
You're a really strange cat.

242
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,530
Tomoya-kun.

243
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,440
Tomoya-kun.

244
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,880
You had a good nap there?

245
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,840
You looked like my cat.

246
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,650
It's getting late, so let's make our way back.

247
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,890
Yeah.

248
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,590
Sorry we stayed for so long.

249
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,760
It's fine.

250
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,900
Make sure you have him take you to the Autumn Festival.

251
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,600
Yes.

252
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,780
Did you show me that dream?

253
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,910
So you do have a name after all.

254
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,420
So there are things you want me to tell her, eh?

255
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,010
What's the matter, Tomoya-kun?

256
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,000
You've had something on
your mind since yesterday.

257
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,110
Yeah, I've been thinking about how to let Misae-san know about something.

258
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,400
It's Misae-san's kitty.

259
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,570
What's wrong? Is there something you still want to tell me?

260
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,660
Furukawa-san!

261
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,920
And her boyfriend!

262
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,150
Misae-san. Good evening.

263
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,110
Thank goodness you caught him.

264
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,360
Man, I'm out of breath.

265
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,680
Could you fix the way you call me?

266
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,300
Did you come to the festival with your cat?

267
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,840
No. He suddenly dashed out and I came chasing.

268
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,130
I have no idea what he's thinking.

269
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,080
Gosh. I really have to keep an eye on him.

270
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,330
Hey, come out.

271
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,030
I think he's wanted to come to this festival with you for years.

272
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,340
We're going home.

273
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,120
Last night, I think I heard his voice in dream.

274
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,100
He said, "I'm sorry I couldn't be with you until the end of the festival."

275
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,720
Anything else?

276
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,500
Did he say anything else?

277
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,070
And, "As you wished, I'll always be with you."

278
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,130
I don't remember saying I would go on a date with a cat.

279
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,320
But I guess I'll play with you a lot today.

280
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,240
There's one more thing to tell you, Misae-san.

281
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,290
He wishes for you to find your happiness.

282
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,500
After all, he's like that, right?

283
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,360
He's worried about you.

284
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,760
Yeah, you're right. He is like that.

285
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,090
He was.

286
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,240
Maybe I'll try and enjoy another youth.

287
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,030
Tomoya-kun.

288
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:06,030
Don't worry. I'll tell you about the dream I had last night.

289
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,590
A wondrous love story from the past.

290
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,900
Master.

291
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,300
Master.

292
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:32,410
My current master is not the same as you, but she's a very kind person.

293
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,340
But she makes me worry at times.

294
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,880
Was I able to achieve the goal?

295
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,550
Was I able to achieve the promise we made?

296
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,450
Now, it's been too long ago, and I can't remember.

297
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,560
But right now, I want to remain like this.

298
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,890
Please allow me to...

299
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:15,490
Please allow me to be with her forever.

300
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,200
This is horrible.

301
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,160
Miyazawa!

302
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,470
Sunohara-san... Why?

303
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,700
He just wants to act bossy.

304
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,340
He'll be as high-handed as possible to anyone who's weaker than him.

305
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,510
It's come this far.

306
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,470
Come with us.
