2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,890
We were standing outside the house.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,250
Don't go too far.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,460
Or else we won't be able to get back home.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,600
This is a world that had ended.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,470
There is no one here other than us.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,750
We were looking for junk that could be useful.

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,340
We have to find our own tools for living.

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,200
I'll take this.

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,300
Let's take this back, too.

11
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,520
Were you scared of being alone?

12
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,340
I'm glad you're back.

13
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,290
Thank you.

14
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,600
It's strange.

15
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,060
They had a gentle smell.

16
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,870
Are you eating at the cafeteria for lunch again?

17
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,790
You just got here, didn't you?

18
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,240
Yeah.

19
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,910
Start right. Otherwise, you'll mess up my rhythm.

20
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,680
Fine. Then I'll start over.

21
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,950
Hello, Okazaki.

22
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,140
Are you eating at the cafeteria for lunch again?

23
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,670
You sound so refreshing.

24
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,470
It's too refreshing coming from you.

25
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,840
You weirded me out with your change in character.

26
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,320
Then what am I supposed to do?!

27
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,700
At the end of the sentence, always add the phrase, "and a toilet seat cover".

28
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,210
That will counter the freshness and make you sound more like yourself.

29
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,670
All right.

30
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,360
I'll do it one of these days when I feel like it.

31
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,220
What? Mei's staying over at Nagisa-chan's again?

32
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,720
We're perfectly happy having her.

33
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,190
Since we all love Mei-chan.

34
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,310
She called ahead and let
her parents and school know.

35
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,940
Apparently she's worried about you.

36
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,780
Onii-chan's a senior, and it's the second semester, yet he still doesn't know what he'll be doing.

37
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,110
I'm so worried I can't go home.

38
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,190
She said she wants to have a good talk with you later.

39
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:18,330
Sunohara-san. Do you have a goal or something you want to do?

40
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,630
I've never thought about it.

41
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,760
I can't go to college, so I'll find a job and work.

42
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:35,020
Well, if I had a level-headed girlfriend, too, I bet my sister would rest easier.

43
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,950
That's it!

44
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,240
Basically, we'll show her that you have
a girlfriend who you've sworn your life to.

45
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,690
I'm sure Mei-chan will stop worrying that way.

46
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,250
I don't think you should tell her a lie.

47
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,160
Would something like that work?

48
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,190
So you know, you're actually not that ugly.

49
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,820
You've got a baby face, so you're the type that tickles the maternal instinct.

50
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,170
This school's number one baby face.

51
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,710
Baby Sunohara.

52
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,710
Y-You think so?

53
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,330
You might end up dating the fake girlfriend with this as a start.

54
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,660
Okazaki magic, eh?

55
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,970
I'm starting to get fired up!

56
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,140
Tomoya-kun. Aren't you just having fun?

57
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,020
Not at all.

58
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,700
Are there any obedient girls who'll probably listen to me?

59
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,180
You're really underhanded, you know.

60
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,610
I found a perfect candidate!

61
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,000
Go!

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,920
Wait!

63
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,160
You're going to ask her?!

64
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,690
You don't have to be that surprised.

65
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,840
Pretend. It's just pretend.

66
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,020
If you can't, you can say no.

67
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,170
Since you know well what kind of a guy he is.

68
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,540
I can't. It's impossible.

69
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,430
It's too much for me.

70
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,730
Just thinking about it is so embarrassing...

71
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,900
I can't possibly...

72
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,370
Please don't cry, Ryou-chan.

73
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,740
When you see something like this,
doesn't it make you want to keep going?

74
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,030
Hey. If you say something like that...

75
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,430
Are you all right, Ryou?

76
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,380
Was he picking on you?

77
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,280
I'm all right.

78
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,990
It wasn't anything like that.

79
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,640
You two. What did you do to my cute sister?!

80
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,520
You misunderstand, Kyou-chan.

81
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,640
We're actually looking for a fake girlfriend for Sunohara-san.

82
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,730
How about we try asking Kyou?

83
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,900
I doubt she'd say yes.

84
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,410
Yeah, given her character...

85
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,390
Vicious and hot-headed, says unreasonable things and uses me like a slave.

86
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,760
I can hear everything you're saying, you know?

87
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,700
You care to repeat those words?

88
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,080
If you can, I'll stick my hand into your mouth and rip out your vocal cords as a reward.

89
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,460
I-I'm sorry.

90
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,920
I apologized, didn't I?!

91
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,180
Your apologizing face pissed me off for some reason.

92
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,190
Let's go, Ryou.

93
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,110
Their idiocy will infect us if we stay.

94
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,220
Okay...

95
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,660
Why do guys lack delicacy so much?

96
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,190
I'll see you later.

97
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,450
Are you really all right, Sunohara-san?

98
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,110
Don't worry. He shines brightest when he's being picked on by girls.

99
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,120
Don't say things that'll cause misunderstandings!

100
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,420
But with both Fujibayashi and Kyou down, who else might say yes?

101
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,330
How about asking Tomoyo-san?

102
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,380
Are you serious?

103
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,250
She's beautiful and takes good care of others.

104
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,220
I think she's a nice person.

105
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,320
We'd better not.

106
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,720
He's wimping out, too.

107
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,800
Don't be an idiot! Who's w-wimping out?!

108
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,230
You had an extra "w" there.

109
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,070
Take a deep breath and calm down first.

110
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,990
Okay. I'm ready to give birth to a good kid.

111
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,330
Sunohara-san, you're panicking.

112
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,690
If you think about it, she and I are fated rivals.

113
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,870
We would fight every time
we bumped into each other.

114
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,780
What's wrong? You seem troubled; that's unlike you.

115
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,440
It's got nothing to do with you.

116
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,140
I guess you're right.

117
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,470
But...

118
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,940
I don't want to see you lose to anyone other than me.

119
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,910
Deep down, there's mutual respect between those who recognize each other's strength.

120
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,120
It's so touching!

121
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,650
Therefore I'm going!

122
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,700
Tea stains are actually tannin.

123
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,990
Baking soda is often used to wash them off.

124
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,900
If you don't have any-

125
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,760
If you don't have any,
vinegar should be fine, too.

126
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,680
Don't ignore me like that!

127
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,340
Sakagami-san, you know him?

128
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,260
Stay away. It's dangerous to make eye contact with him.

129
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,020
Don't talk of me like I'm an animal!

130
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,270
Tomoyo-san. Please listen to what he has to say.

131
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,150
Oh, Furukawa-san.

132
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,320
Yesterday's baseball game was fun, wasn't it?

133
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,910
Yes.

134
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,160
You looked really cool.

135
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,570
It's actually my first time calling you Furukawa-san, isn't it?

136
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,290
Was that all right?

137
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,060
Of course.

138
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,190
I'm happy.

139
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,670
Could you two not carry on a conversation without me?!

140
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,080
What, you were still here?

141
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,550
He has a favor to ask. Could you hear him out?

142
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,180
You guys come asking for favors a lot, don't you?

143
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,350
I'm really troubled right now, you know?

144
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,310
You look carefree to me, as you always do.

145
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,940
It's got nothing to do with you.

146
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,610
Exactly. See you.

147
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,250
No! You're supposed to say, "I don't want to see you lose to anyone other than me."

148
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,990
I've never considered saying that in my life, not even the slightest bit.

149
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,370
Just say it! Or else it won't make any progress!

150
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,960
I don't want to see you lose to anyone other than me.

151
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,710
"Lose"? Who?

152
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,790
How about we-

153
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,970
If he wanted to fight, he should have said so immediately.

154
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,310
See you, Okazaki.

155
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,780
Furukawa-san, too.

156
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,930
That was so cool.

157
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,640
As expected of Sakagami-san.

158
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,690
Okay. I'll help.

159
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,680
Seriously?!

160
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,690
You're so kind, Kotomi-chan.

161
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,010
I want to be of help to my friend.

162
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,570
Tell me what I should do.

163
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:08,480
If you're dating, I think you would hang out and do all sorts of fun things together.

164
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,420
That's right.

165
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,920
What should we do?

166
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,120
Then...

167
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,460
Look at what you made her do!

168
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,340
Didn't the violin get fixed?!

169
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,370
Yes. It makes better sound than before.

170
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,890
It's actually gotten worse!

171
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,810
Was it really all right, Sunohara-san?

172
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,690
She agreed to act for you.

173
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,560
I don't have the willpower to make it through that sound.

174
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't give up.

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,230
We still have one hope.

176
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,240
Miyazawa, are you here?

177
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,720
Okazaki-san, Furukawa-san, Sunohara-san.

178
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,870
Long time no see.

179
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,260
Yes, it has been a while, Miyazawa-san.

180
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,840
Yukine-chan, eh?

181
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,500
Yeah, you look like you'll do anything.

182
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,250
What is this about?

183
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,230
To act as a girlfriend, is it?

184
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,260
It sounds difficult.

185
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,230
That's not true!

186
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,760
I'll lead you along well.

187
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,560
So please. Yeah?

188
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,830
I've been listening for a while...

189
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:22,130
Who do you think you are to ask such a thing of our Yuki-nee?!

190
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,060
"Our Yuki-nee?"

191
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,860
Miyazawa-san, who is this person?

192
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,000
He's my guest.

193
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,370
There is a small issue, so he is hiding here.

194
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,040
Let me tell you clearly!

195
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,960
If you cause any trouble for Yuki-nee, we won't let you live.

196
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,930
Do you hear?!

197
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,200
Crap, I wasn't supposed to come out.

198
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,020
Yuki-nee, if anything happens, call me.

199
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,710
I'll dash over.

200
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,570
You shouldn't go out yet.

201
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,880
You need to hide.

202
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,020
I'm sorry, I need to excuse myself.

203
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,160
What was that about?

204
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,340
Looks like she has some things to deal with, too.

205
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,560
I'm going to leave you two here.

206
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,750
I have to help make dinner.

207
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,130
Good luck, Sunohara-san.

208
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,510
"Good luck" she says, but...

209
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,510
It wasn't right to ask for free.

210
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,520
Let's put out a reward.

211
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,830
I don't have any money.

212
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,760
That doesn't matter, since you're going to charm her, anyway, right?

213
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,020
That's right.

214
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,310
First, you have to flatter the girl.

215
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,360
And, girls these days like to keep secrets, so let her know that secrets are safe with you.

216
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,530
Lastly, using group psychology to your advantage, appeal saying that everyone does it.

217
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,650
Got it.

218
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,710
I'm off then.

219
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,300
Hey there cutie!

220
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,060
What?

221
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,840
Do you have some time right now?

222
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,350
It'd be great if you would even just listen to what I need to say.

223
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,700
I actually have a good part-time job for you.

224
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,050
I'm in a hurry.

225
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,630
I won't say your name.

226
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,560
And I'll keep it a secret to your parents, too.

227
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,980
Don't worry. Everyone's doing it.

228
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,030
That makes me sound like I'm scouting her for something sketchy!

229
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,590
Um...

230
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,490
Sanae-san!

231
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,710
Are you having some trouble?

232
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,960
Oh.

233
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,830
If that's the case, would you allow me to help?

234
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,860
Are you serious, Sanae-san?

235
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,310
It's for none other than
Mei-chan's brother's sake.

236
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,840
If I can be of help, then I'll gladly do so.

237
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,390
W-W-Wait a moment.

238
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,580
Okazaki. She's Nagisa-chan's older sister, right?

239
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,920
Sister?

240
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,860
Ah, right. I said something like that yesterday, didn't I?

241
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,970
Crap! As expected from Nagisa-chan's sister!

242
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,770
She's so freaking hot when I see her up close.

243
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,490
This is interesting, so I'll let him keep thinking wrong.

244
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,550
Um...

245
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,170
Would I not be fitting?

246
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,630
That's not true at all!

247
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,210
But wouldn't it be too obvious that you're a fake girlfriend?

248
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,310
It'll be all right. I'll go in a disguise.

249
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,320
Then you're serious?

250
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,980
Yes. I look forward to acting with you.

251
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,390
Yahoo!

252
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,970
Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo!

253
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,220
You have a girlfriend?!

254
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,180
Someone I've sworn my future to.

255
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,710
She's really beautiful and level-headed.

256
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,500
I'm not living aimlessly.

257
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,150
I'm walking up the stairs to adulthood one step at a time.

258
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,650
Let me see her.

259
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,800
Introduce me to her.

260
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,410
As your younger sister, I want to know what kind of person you're going to marry!

261
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,180
Okay. Then I'll ask what her schedule's like.

262
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,740
The Theater Club has many costumes, doesn't it?

263
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,950
You'll meet Mei-chan the day after tomorrow.

264
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,880
So tomorrow will be a practice run.

265
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,680
Okay. I'm looking forward to it.

266
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,460
It feels complicated to me.

267
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,210
My mom is my classmate's girlfriend...

268
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,690
Are you really sure about this?

269
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,850
Sunohara's really hyped up over this.

270
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,170
He thinks of you as Nagisa's older sister.

271
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,680
Sister?

272
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,760
Thank you very much.

273
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,700
I wasn't trying to flatter you...

274
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,180
Shouldn't you reconsider this, Mom?

275
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,340
Sunohara-san has been on my mind
since the baseball game.

276
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,350
He's looks clumsy and makes many mistakes, but I think he's actually a very kind person.

277
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,850
With a push, I think he can start walking a better path.

278
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,610
I want to help him get there.

279
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:18,880
Okay. If you think so, then I'll help, too.

280
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,770
Yes. Thank you very much.

281
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,490
Let me say one thing.

282
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,790
We need to keep this a secret to the old man.

283
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,850
Okay?

284
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,500
Why?

285
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,260
Sanae-san might be doing it for the sake of helping others,

286
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,600
but knowing him, he might fly into a jealous rage and turn Sunohara into mincemeat.

287
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,040
For Sunohara's safety,
we need to keep this a secret.

288
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,430
Sunohara-san's really nervous.

289
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,720
Watching him is pissing me off.

290
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,820
Why?

291
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,780
Don't tell me you're in love with Mom, too.

292
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,580
You idiot! What are you saying?!

293
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,670
Um...

294
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,770
Y-Yes!

295
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,260
It would be strange to call you "Sunohara-kun" when we're dating, so I'll call you "Youhei-kun".

296
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,650
Y-Y-Y-Yeah?

297
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,030
Youhei-kun.

298
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,800
I look forward to spending time with you.

299
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,310
Crap! She called me "Youhei-kun"!

300
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,690
Shall we begin with walking next to each other?

301
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,720
Y-Y-Y-Yes!

302
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,080
You can come closer.

303
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,310
Since we're dating.

304
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,320
Crap! I smelled something sweet!

305
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,360
How about we hold hands, too?

306
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,300
Crap! It's so soft!

307
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,390
Don't come reporting to me each time.

308
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,980
Is that really making him go down the right path?

309
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,900
It feels complicated to me, after all...

310
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,680
And so the day comes.

311
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,200
Sunohara-san's here already.

312
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,740
Mei-chan, call out to him from behind.

313
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,740
I bet he'll think it's his girl and be surprised.

314
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,340
Then I'll give it a little try.

315
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,130
Did you wait long?

316
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,920
No, I just got here.

317
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,420
MEI?!

318
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,240
Sunohara-san, what are all of these cans?

319
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,650
This is part of my strategy.

320
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,210
She'll see this when she gets here, right?

321
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,510
Then...

322
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,560
Sunohara-san...

323
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,170
You waited for me this long?

324
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,900
You see how it goes?

325
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,530
You're really underhanded.

326
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,870
This is the game in the name of love guys play.

327
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,950
In other words, it's a boy love game.

328
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,450
So you know, that implies something different.

329
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,980
Crap. I drank too much and nature calls.

330
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,710
If it's this messy, it'll be a bother, right?

331
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,060
Yeah.

332
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,400
Let's clean it up.

333
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,160
Yes.

334
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,450
Let me help, too.

335
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,150
Thank you.

336
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,690
It's nothing.

337
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,120
This is rather...

338
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,430
Tomoya-kun, are you blushing?

339
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,830
That felt good.

340
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,580
Youhei-kun.

341
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,540
I'm sorry! Did I make you wait?!

342
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,880
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

343
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,880
Not at all. I just arrived.

344
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,050
This person is my brother's girlfriend?

345
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,080
Enjoy your time with her.

346
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,240
Hold on, Mei.

347
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,910
Y-Yeah, but I shouldn't go in case Sanae-san calls.

348
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,180
But love is a person's choice.

349
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,570
Wait?
