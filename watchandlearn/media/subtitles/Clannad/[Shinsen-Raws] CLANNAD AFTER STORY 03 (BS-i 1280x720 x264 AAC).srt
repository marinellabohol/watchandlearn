00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,060
I'm Isogai Sanako, 17 years old.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,940
Your brother always takes good care of me.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,800
Have we met somewhere before?

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,180
It is a small city, so we may have passed each other on the road.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,610
You're really beautiful.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,470
Thank you very much.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,040
You're so beautiful, yet...

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,340
Yet Onii-chan has...

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,750
I feel sorry for you!

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,090
What's that supposed to mean?!

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,630
Get off! Get off of her!

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,200
Good. Mei-chan didn't figure out that she's Sanae-san.

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,800
Please, I'm begging you, so get off of her.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm surprised, too.

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,980
I couldn't tell she was my mom for a moment.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,770
Hey, there's a ghost right here.

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,930
I'll tell on you to mom!

19
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,290
I still think I've met her somewhere before.

20
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,490
It's your imagination.

21
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,180
Where do you think Sunohara-san is headed to?

22
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,270
Maybe some food to start out?

23
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,480
But does he know any classy restaurants?

24
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,510
Hey Nagisa. Do you remember what's around here?

25
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,550
No... I'm sorry, I can't remember.

26
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,170
Sa-Sanako-san. Would you be hungry at all?

27
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,310
Yes, a little.

28
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,860
Then there's a place I often go to.
How about we start by filling our stomachs?

29
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,970
That sounds good. Take me there.

30
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,020
This is the place I visit regularly.

31
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,780
It's a really nice place.

32
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,030
Onii-chan...

33
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,760
My recommendation is the pork cutlet bowl.

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,910
I eat it like three times a day.

35
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,460
It's an expensive store, so average students stay away from here.

36
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,710
Youhei-kun.

37
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,580
You regularly eat here?

38
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,200
And only pork cutlet bowls?

39
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,440
Someone like me can.

40
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,520
It's ready.

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,060
Yay!

42
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,020
Itadakimasu!

43
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,060
Thank you for the food.

44
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,780
It was delicious!

45
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,780
But the flavoring tasted familiar.

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,220
Eating only pork cutlet bowls is an unbalanced diet.

47
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,750
Please try cooking for yourself from now on.

48
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,330
Yes!

49
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,320
You're really kind, Sanako-san.

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,420
You're so kind, yet Onii-chan has...

51
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,500
I feel sorry for you!

52
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,930
Would you stop that?!

53
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,940
Where could they be going next?

54
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,180
I bet to a movie or shopping.
One of those standard activities.

55
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,900
Yeah. Who would want to be taken to an arcade right off the bat, right?

56
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,940
This is horrible.

57
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,970
Yeah.

58
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,160
Sunohara-san's really into it.

59
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,460
What's wrong with this thing? I bet it's broken.

60
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,460
You can't do that, Youhei-kun.

61
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,470
Let's get out of this place.

62
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,540
Let's go to a CD store next.

63
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,960
His taste in music is...

64
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,250
It's horrible.

65
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,100
Look, I found it. It's my favorite group.

66
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,350
Thank you very much.

67
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,280
There.

68
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,490
He's completely hopeless today.

69
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,310
It's getting a little dark.

70
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,150
The night's just starting.

71
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,280
Let's go to a place that has some great scenery!

72
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,980
He still wants to take her around?

73
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,530
Shouldn't Sanae-san head home soon?

74
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,900
Yes. We need to start preparing dinner.

75
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,250
No!

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,690
You're in the way.

77
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,620
We can't play, you know?

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,010
I'm not moving.

79
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,630
I said get off!

80
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,310
You're in the way.

81
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,520
No.

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,500
Is it bothering you?

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,300
Yes.

84
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,110
I'll go stop them.

85
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,190
Please wait.

86
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,040
I'll go stop them.

87
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,520
What's the big deal?

88
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,020
But...

89
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,040
That's nothing.

90
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,990
Kids grow up through fighting.

91
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,740
Onii-chan...

92
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,870
Hey!

93
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,080
Don't pick on my sister!

94
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,880
Looks like the matter's settled.

95
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,790
Shall we move on?

96
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,340
But um... Something looks wrong.

97
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,520
Would you wait here for a moment?

98
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,360
Looks like they left home on an errand but got lost.

99
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,360
While the brother was looking for the way home, the sister was bullied by those boys.

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,090
Lost children, eh?

101
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,760
I want to find their house for them.

102
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,870
It's fine. They'll find their way home.

103
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,400
Onii-chan!

104
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,800
Come on now...

105
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,740
We should ask their names first.

106
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,000
You're right.

107
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,410
What are your names?

108
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,450
She has a name tag on her clothes.

109
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,680
Great! There's an address written on the back, too.

110
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,670
This isn't far from here.

111
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,430
Shall we go?

112
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,230
Aren't you glad to be able to go home?

113
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,310
I'm glad it was closer than expected.

114
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,910
Yes.

115
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,100
Their parents looked really happy.

116
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,120
Why don't you stop with
the attitude and come up here?

117
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,340
Are you upset with me, Youhei-kun?

118
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,670
No. I don't care.

119
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,680
It was our date.

120
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,260
Onii-chan, you're still saying something like that?!

121
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,980
Youhei-kun. Please don't be so upset.

122
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,100
If you don't mind, I'd like to see you again.

123
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,810
Really?!

124
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,620
It makes me happy that you feel the time we spend together is so important.

125
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,630
But at times, there are things that are more important.

126
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,830
Please don't lose sight of that.

127
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,240
O-Okay!

128
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,490
Hello, Okazaki.

129
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,380
And a toilet seat cover.

130
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,550
You sound really cheerful.

131
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,310
Let's go get food.

132
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,240
Oh, and a toilet seat cover.

133
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,940
I'll only get food, thanks.

134
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,450
I'll have a pork cutlet bowl.

135
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,520
And a toilet seat cover.

136
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,470
You'll upset your stomach.

137
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,530
Oh, but Sanae-san told me
to watch my diet, didn't she?

138
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,450
And a toilet seat cover.

139
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,910
Mei-chan was worried about you last night, too.

140
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,610
She said you didn't change despite finding such a nice girlfriend.

141
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,960
Yeah, I should reconsider stuff for
Sanae-san's sake, too, like my future.

142
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,490
And a toilet seat cover.

143
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,920
You're thinking about such a thing for Sanae-san?

144
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,220
When I was a kid, I had so many things I wanted to become.

145
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,620
A soccer player.

146
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,900
A pilot.

147
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,100
So cool!

148
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,130
A teacher.

149
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,800
Stunning!

150
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,690
And...

151
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,190
...a toilet seat cover!

152
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,970
They all sound difficult to become.

153
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,790
I can't keep doing it!

154
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,010
Just adding "and a toilet seat cover"
at the end ruins any kind of serious talk!

155
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,410
Then quit doing it.

156
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,710
You're the one who told me to do it!

157
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,870
I did?

158
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,790
Well, I won't get mad at you today.

159
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,590
A guy in love has a forgiving heart.

160
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,090
You're in a really good mood, aren't you?

161
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,670
Of course I am.

162
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,090
She's supposed to call me after school.

163
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,950
It must be that she seriously fell in love with me.

164
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,000
Sunohara. Why don't you think about Mei-chan a-

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,740
If I get married to Sanae-san and you to Nagisa-chan,

166
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,430
that'll make us brothers.

167
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,110
I look forward to that day, my younger brother!

168
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,300
It's good!

169
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,030
Maybe it had the wrong effect.

170
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,480
I think so.

171
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
That idiot's totally out of his mind.

172
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,040
Mei-chan. Are you waiting for Sunohara-san?

173
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,740
Yes. You're not with him?

174
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,710
He went home already.

175
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,350
He says he shouldn't miss his girl's call.

176
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,090
Gosh, he's hopeless.

177
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,680
Would you not bother me?

178
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,410
Sunohara-san...

179
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,060
Hey! Your sister came all the way to check on you. You shouldn't be saying that.

180
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,650
When in midst of love, sisters go out of sight.

181
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,050
Love is amazing!

182
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,740
Rather than that, Mei,
shouldn't you go home soon?

183
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,050
I'm not going home yet.

184
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,900
There's something I have to do.

185
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,980
Something you have to do?

186
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,960
Ah, I gotcha.

187
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,170
What could they be talking about?

188
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,470
So basically, checking me out was an excuse to begin with.

189
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,810
She's always loved the city,
so she wanted to spend some time here.

190
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,830
Right?

191
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,560
That's right.

192
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,720
See?

193
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,380
But that's not all.

194
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,860
The person I like is here, so I came to meet him.

195
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,220
P-Person you like?!

196
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,310
Someone I met the last time I was here.

197
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,150
He's really mature and
teaches me all sorts of fun things.

198
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,250
And he's kind, too.

199
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,100
He says I'm cute, too.

200
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,870
Hold on, Mei.

201
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,880
Love is amazing, isn't it, Onii-chan?

202
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,670
Wait!

203
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,290
Who exactly is the-

204
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,900
I'm supposed to see him after this.

205
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,900
PLACEHOLDER

206
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,160
So I have to go now.

207
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,160
PLACEHOLDER

208
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,770
Enjoy your time with her.

209
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,320
Mei-chan!

210
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,610
Please wait!

211
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,640
Hey! You should go after her, too!

212
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,860
Y-Yeah, but I shouldn't go in case Sanae-san calls.

213
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,090
Are you still saying something like that?!

214
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,650
What are you going to do if the guy is some scumbag?

215
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,070
But love is a person's choice.

216
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,010
Onii-chan?

217
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,460
Sorry. It's me.

218
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,450
I understand how you got upset at him,
but wasn't that a little much?

219
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,950
What are you going to do now? You're only complicating things.

220
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,230
I don't want to see Onii-chan like that.

221
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,960
I wanted him to come after me
and tell me not to go with a guy like that.

222
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,190
I didn't mind if he hit me.

223
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,990
I was ready for him to.

224
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,190
I wanted him to yell at me...

225
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,350
When I was little, I was picked on
by boys in our neighborhood all the time.

226
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,740
But Onii-chan was always there to help me.

227
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,490
When I was crying, Onii-chan would always come running to me.

228
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,360
Saying, "Stop making Mei cry!"

229
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,620
It made me really happy and was reassuring.

230
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,870
After starting middle school,
he started to become really good at soccer.

231
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,960
He was counted on not only by me,
but by everyone in the team, too.

232
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,230
He's not the brother I used to know.

233
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,920
He wouldn't keep his mouth shut after seeing a girl picked on.

234
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,770
He's supposed to worry about me, too.

235
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,270
Okazaki-san. That girlfriend of Onii-chan's was a fake, right?

236
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,250
Yeah, we knew you'd figure it out.

237
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,280
The one who played the role of his girlfriend was my mom.

238
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,400
Sorry we lied to you.

239
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,140
I knew it...

240
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,270
Gosh, he's so hopeless...

241
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,000
Causing so much trouble for everyone...

242
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,130
No, we never thought of him like that!

243
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,740
He's so hopeless...

244
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,810
You're going on a date with Sunohara again?

245
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,310
Yes. To make up for the last time.

246
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,980
I don't think there's a need to go in disguise.

247
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,480
I've come to like this outfit.

248
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,400
Hey, what are you all doing here?

249
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,860
S-Sanae?!

250
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,310
Dad, you're amazing!
You knew this was Mom instantly!

251
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,190
Akio-san, this is for-

252
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,400
Mom!

253
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,370
Shh! It's a secret.

254
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,120
What? What are you guys planning on doing?

255
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,430
We were practicing theater.

256
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,360
Theater?

257
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,630
That's right.

258
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,340
We wanted Sanae-san to
help out with the practice.

259
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,260
But man, they're all girls' clothes.

260
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,230
Sanae-san, please go on.

261
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,350
What kind of play is this?

262
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,910
We're still in the process of coming up with the plot.

263
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,410
Excuse me then.

264
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,290
Where did Sanae go?

265
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,160
She probably ran away in embarrassment.

266
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,420
She's cute no matter how old she gets.

267
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,540
So, what's the story going to be like this time?

268
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,260
Nagisa's the one coming up with the plot again.

269
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,750
Sounds like she's hit a wall,
so would you give her some advice?

270
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,490
We'll go look for Sanae-san.

271
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,800
You got it.

272
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,470
They weren't meeting here?

273
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,030
I didn't hear anything.

274
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,600
I was planning on following Sanae-san.

275
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,970
Well, I'm sure we can leave Sanae-san alone.

276
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,770
How about we go hang out somewhere, too?

277
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,650
If you only worry about Sunohara, it'll tire you out, right?

278
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,970
It's so cute!

279
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,650
It'll probably look good on you.

280
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,300
I wish you were really my brother.

281
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Do you really mean that?

282
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,670
I do.

283
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,230
Then try treating me like I'm your brother.

284
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,920
Like you're my brother?

285
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,300
Then...

286
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,010
Hey, Onii-chan.

287
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,860
What's wrong, Onii-chan?

288
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,010
N-Nothing.

289
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,460
That was more effective than I'd thought.

290
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,480
What are you saying?
You're so weird, Onii-chan.

291
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,740
This is dangerous.

292
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,380
No more "Onii-chan"!

293
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,330
Why? I can't call you "Onii-chan", Onii-chan?

294
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,700
Actually, don't stop.

295
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,640
You guys...

296
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,540
Since when?

297
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,460
He's making Mei-chan call him "Onii-chan".

298
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,750
He's dangerous.

299
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,740
He looked really turned on.

300
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,590
Oka... Okazaki-kun...

301
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,670
No. There's a reason behind this.

302
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,170
We didn't see anything.

303
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,260
You'll infect us with your idiocy.

304
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,240
Run for it.

305
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,300
You got it wrong!

306
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,020
Hurry!

307
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,020
Wait...

308
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,430
Don't follow us!

309
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,520
No more "Onii-chan" after all!

310
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,560
Actually, I take that back.

311
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
Onii-chan. What should Mei do?

312
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,250
No more!

313
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,180
I forbid it!!!

314
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,700
Wow! There are so many to choose from!

315
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,110
The city is amazing after all.

316
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,380
This isn't really a city, you know.

317
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,220
Want me to treat you?

318
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,550
Really?

319
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,120
Then I'll have...

320
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,720
This one!

321
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,000
I've never seen something like this before!

322
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,290
Princess Crepe?

323
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,140
She's right, I've never seen anything like this before.

324
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,050
Hey, the price is princess-like, too.

325
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,990
Girls are unbelievable.

326
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,980
How about something else?

327
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,360
How about the Maharajah Crepe-

328
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,820
Onii-chan...

329
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,340
Mei wants to eat the Princess Crepe.

330
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,200
It's delicious!

331
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,790
I'm such a...

332
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,580
Do you want to try some, too?

333
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,850
Then I'll take a bite.

334
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,960
You took the strawberry.

335
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,610
You said I can try some.

336
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,550
I hate you, Onii-chan.

337
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,350
No! Don't hate me!

338
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,900
Then can we do that together?

339
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,810
Then I'll forgive you.

340
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,910
You're kidding. That's so lame.

341
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,310
Strawberry!

342
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,310
Okay, okay!

343
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,320
Maybe it's this?

344
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,780
This?

345
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,150
This is so exciting.

346
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,030
Choose a frame you like.

347
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,010
Which one do you want?

348
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,670
This one!

349
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,540
Okay.

350
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,790
We'll now take the picture.

351
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,290
Okay!

352
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,420
Ready?

353
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,540
Say "Cheese!"

354
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,340
This is really embarrassing, you know?

355
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,070
Okazaki-san! Make sure you put it on your student ID!

356
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,000
No way!

357
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,370
Hey.

358
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,990
Where've you been?

359
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,700
I was meeting my girlfriend.

360
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,570
What were you two doing?

361
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,490
We were looking for-

362
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,600
What's this?

363
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,490
What's the meaning of this?

364
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,800
It's none of your business!

365
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,110
Give it back to me!

366
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,000
Man, looks like the truth has come out.

367
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,160
It's just as you imagined.

368
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,960
Mei-chan's boyfriend turns out to be me.

369
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,720
What happened to Nagisa-chan?

370
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,050
Obviously, I'm breaking up with her.

371
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,990
The truth is, Mei-chan actually stayed over at my place last night, too.

372
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,390
Right, Mei?

373
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,980
Y-Yeah. I was alone with Okazaki-san, too.

374
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,990
Shall we get a move on, Mei?

375
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,830
Yes.

376
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,200
Wait...

377
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,420
I said wait...

378
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Why does it have to turn out like that?

379
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,350
Damn it!

380
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,040
And nothing more?

381
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,380
I tried to pull off an act thinking we'd make him worry.

382
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,260
I'm sorry, all for our sake...

383
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,070
It's all right.

384
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,640
But even with all the provocation, he didn't say anything.

385
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,330
I was hoping he'd show his "reliable brother" side.

386
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,130
It looks like he doesn't care about me.

387
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,160
That can't be true!

388
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,390
But, lying is wrong.

389
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,350
Mei-chan, shouldn't you go home soon?

390
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,080
You've been absent from school a whole week.

391
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,250
Your parents must be worried about you, too.

392
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,290
I can't go home leaving things the way they are.

393
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,650
Not until Onii-chan gets his act together.

394
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,040
Okazaki-san.

395
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,500
I want Onii-chan to play soccer again.

396
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,300
If he plays soccer again, maybe he'll return to the way he used to be.

397
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,260
If possible, he should return to the Soccer Team and...

398
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,320
I think that's difficult.

399
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,930
You know what happened between Sunohara and the Soccer Team, right?

400
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,110
But I think that's our only chance.

401
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,080
I'm busy taking care of matters with Sanae-san.

402
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,310
I don't have time to worry about Mei.

403
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,620
Mei-chan, let's think it through.

404
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:06,210
He has alot of good traits
but just can't express them well.

405
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,470
You wanna fight, Okazaki?
