2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,700
You worked really well today.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,690
What?

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,790
You learn things fast and do them right, too.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,720
You could be well-suited for this kind of job.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,630
Could it be... Are you complimenting me?

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,140
Don't get too full of yourself, though.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,830
We're doing the same thing every day,
so of course you'd improve.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,190
Right.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:37,590
All those people I studied with back then
went to college, and must be in some city.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,870
I'm here alone.

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,760
But I'm not by myself.

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,840
There are people who get covered in dirt and grime every day like me.

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,380
It's the new place I've chosen and have earned.

15
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,510
Now, here's a quiz.

16
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,830
Thank you.

17
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,830
Here he goes again.

18
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,180
Which of the following is this summer's first big event I came up with?

19
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,310
One: BBQ at the Beach.

20
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,270
Two: RIP at the Beach

21
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,730
Three: Barbara Fujioka at the Beach.

22
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,290
They all sound so similar.

23
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,010
The last one was completely different.

24
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,780
The "bar" sound is the same!

25
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,920
You go play with Barbara Fujioka alone!

26
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,950
Who is that, anyway?

27
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,310
I haven't had a chance to play with Nagisa, so I'm lonely.

28
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,920
I don't care what it is;
I just want some time with her.

29
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,870
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,320
It's natural for you two to spend a lot of time together, but it's hard to let go of one's child.

31
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,280
I see.

32
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,760
Is it something like that?

33
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,860
Your place is really lively as always.

34
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,500
What's on your mind?

35
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,150
Um, there's something I want to talk to you about.

36
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,280
What? You want a swimsuit?

37
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,300
No, it's not that.

38
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,450
Oh, but it's not that I don't want one.

39
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,280
All right then. I get out early tomorrow, so let's go buy one tomorrow evening.

40
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,910
What? Is that all right?

41
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,090
I bet you only have the school's swimsuit, right?

42
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,760
Yes. But I don't mind that at all.

43
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,420
I do.

44
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,980
After all, you want to see
your girlfriend looking cute.

45
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,840
Be the beach queen.

46
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,060
What? Me in a swimsuit is...

47
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,220
Don't say that. We'll have fun shopping tomorrow.

48
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,970
Yes.

49
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,520
All right, then-

50
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,070
That's not what I wanted to say.

51
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,570
It wasn't a swimsuit?

52
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,310
Then-

53
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,220
Tomoya-kun.

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,480
Tomoya-kun, have you met with
your father properly after you've moved?

55
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,220
Have you told him your new address?

56
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,430
No.

57
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,880
You know that there's a distance between him and I.

58
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,610
It's a distance that can never be closed.

59
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,130
But!

60
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,270
I'm working every day.

61
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,980
I'm working until I'm completely exhausted.

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,360
I want to be with you at least on my day-offs.

63
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,070
I don't want to do anything unpleasant.

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,660
It doesn't have to be now.

65
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,750
Let's go meet him together one day.

66
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,310
Yeah.

67
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,110
One day.

68
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,550
Yes. One day.

69
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,850
My old colleague is working as
an assistant director at the principal contractor.

70
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,620
He's looking for a young person who could manage a site.

71
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,600
I see.

72
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,200
First as a trainee,

73
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,140
but of course eventually as full staff.

74
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,690
They said they'll pay... about this much, too.

75
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,230
That's amazing.

76
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,490
And I'm thinking of recommending you.

77
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,530
Would you be interested in going?

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,240
W-Wait a moment please. Are you firing me?!

79
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,900
Don't get it wrong.

80
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,380
He's recommending you because he cares.

81
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,180
I won't ask you to make a decision now.

82
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,910
But I hope you would give it some thought.

83
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,580
Yes...

84
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,890
What's there to hesitate over?

85
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,380
But I was thinking of building my career at this company.

86
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,770
Besides, you're more of
an immediate help than me.

87
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,980
I'm bad at socializing.

88
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,090
I can be a technician but can't be a manager.

89
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,280
You're younger, so you have more potential.

90
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,140
But this is too sudden.

91
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,260
If you take the offer, your pay will go up.

92
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,290
You'll eventually be supporting a family, too.

93
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,420
Right?

94
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,140
If there's someone important to you, then it's not too difficult to overcome several obstacles.

95
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,880
Did you start working here thinking things like that?

96
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,780
I'm sorry. That was a personal question.

97
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,820
You want to hear an old story?

98
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,070
A story of a boy who sang rock in this city before.

99
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,250
He did whatever he wanted since he was little.

100
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,030
Nobody ever yelled at him,
so he was always doing bad things.

101
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,790
Back then, the band scene was booming.

102
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,050
So he picked up a guitar, too.

103
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,510
Like running up on other people's stages and stealing the mike away.

104
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,210
He was being ridiculous.

105
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,870
When he was a senior in
high school, he met a woman.

106
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,520
She said she liked the love song he sang.

107
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,690
It had embarrassing lyrics,
but she earnestly read the meaning.

108
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,220
Though, she was a clumsy one, for example,

109
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:05,330
forgetting that she was in the middle of heading to class because she talked for too long.

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,880
After graduation, he was planning to live on music.

111
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:18,010
Everyone in class laughed at him, but that teacher cheered him on.

112
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,640
She said, "As long as you continue, it will come true, so don't give up."

113
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,570
On the day he left, he said,

114
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,640
"I definitely will become a professional! If I do, please go out with me!"

115
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,170
He etched in his heart that
he would become a professional.

116
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,950
The debut came pretty fast.

117
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,820
"Take that!"

118
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,110
He wanted to say that to all those who made fun of him.

119
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,020
From that day on, he worked frantically.

120
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,510
He sang what he wanted to sing with everything he had.

121
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,140
Like spitting out.

122
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,140
Like vomiting.

123
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,320
At times, he sang ugly lines, too.

124
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,420
But when he sang with everything he had, it sounded beautiful.

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,510
Living really felt refreshing.

126
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,240
Because to live was the ugliest act.

127
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,920
He had found his place.

128
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,760
One day, a project was brought in from a TV station.

129
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,590
It was to meet fans of his.

130
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,010
Not just any fans.

131
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,540
Fans that were saved by his music and were still facing adversity.

132
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,940
Those who were sick.

133
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,740
Those who got in accidents.

134
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,000
Those who were going through tremendous hardship because of their parents.

135
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,450
Those who had weak minds and were about to break down at any moment.

136
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,040
They all stood in the midst of suffering.

137
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,840
They all used his songs for support.

138
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:27,350
It was a moment he knew his song no longer belonged only to him.

139
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,750
Until that day, he had sung for himself.

140
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,900
But that was no longer true.

141
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:44,780
He had to start composing for thousands of people he had never even met before.

142
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,890
He became unable to compose music.

143
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,480
Because he learned...

144
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,980
...the grandeur of life...

145
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,350
...his shallowness...

146
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,470
...and his insignificance.

147
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,900
The agency told him to take a vacation.

148
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,380
Six month later...

149
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,730
A boy he had met through the TV program committed a crime.

150
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,730
A huge crime that couldn't be taken back.

151
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,450
Everything fell apart from there.

152
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,480
The one who committed the crime was...

153
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,000
...the one who said, "Listening to your songs calms my heart."

154
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,030
"I want to hear your new song soon," the boy had said, speaking more enthusiastically than others.

155
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,550
He thought everything was his fault.

156
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:51,380
He thought he had taken away the cause to live from the boy by not singing.

157
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,760
He started singing again.

158
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,260
He sang the impossible and ideals,

159
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,940
thinking that would save those who waited for him.

160
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,950
He didn't have a clue why he was singing such words himself.

161
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,640
But he continued to sing, ignoring the doubts.

162
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:23,430
The songs eventually deviated from ideals and began to be echoes of a sick reality.

163
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,680
Only realistic pain could be attained from the song.

164
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,270
The lyrics didn't make any sense.

165
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,150
They contradicted each other.

166
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,940
Even then, he continued to sing...

167
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,030
...because he feared the loss of singing the most.

168
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,690
Then...

169
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,740
He resorted to the worst choice.

170
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,220
It was an unforgivable mistake.

171
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,290
No place was left for him
after committing the crime.

172
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:03,300
Nothing to rely on, in the depth of desperation, he made one wish.

173
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
"I want to go home."

174
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,930
Are you keeping up with music?

175
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,850
Everything had changed.

176
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,900
It couldn't have stayed the same.

177
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:03,690
As long as you continue, it will come true.

178
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,980
There was something he never should have lost sight of.

179
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,060
He should have continued singing.

180
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,100
Not for anyone else, but for her.

181
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,640
The love songs for her.

182
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,600
Hey, we're here.

183
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,030
That's the end of the story.

184
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,760
Let's go.

185
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,960
Ah, yes.

186
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,500
Okazaki.

187
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,010
Yes!

188
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,220
Don't lose track of what's important to you.

189
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,150
Yes.

190
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,310
I see.

191
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,850
I think you should choose the path you think is best.

192
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,980
Yeah.

193
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,970
I'll be transferred to another office, but you won't stop me, huh?

194
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,400
I won't, since it's a proof that they have recognized how hard you've been working.

195
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,580
I see.

196
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,370
Yeah.

197
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,900
All right. Let's do it.

198
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,420
Yup.

199
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,420
Bring it on!

200
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,510
You won't play with him?

201
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,850
No, I'm all right.

202
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,150
You'd rather be with your girlfriend than play with children, right?

203
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,400
Really, look at how beautiful Nagisa-chan has become.

204
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,110
Yes, thank you very much.

205
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,200
You look just like me when I was young.

206
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,350
Oh, come on.

207
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,660
Tomorrow's the beach, huh?

208
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,350
I haven't gone to one in a while.

209
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,070
I think you look kinder now, too.

210
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,230
You were talking with a smile to other people, too.

211
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,720
Very naturally at that, aswell.

212
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,670
I always thought things like that were annoying.

213
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,680
And I say this when at school, I stuck my nose into other people's business so much.

214
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,160
You don't feel that way now?

215
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,140
Nagisa.

216
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,980
Sure.

217
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,210
May I pick it up?

218
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,540
Yeah, thanks.

219
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,080
Yes, this is Okazaki.

220
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,910
Yes. Please hold a moment.

221
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,310
Tomoya-kun. It's from Hikarizaka Electric.

222
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,280
Maybe the transfer is complete.

223
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,280
Hello, Okazaki speaking.

224
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,200
Ah, good evening, Manager.

225
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,890
From Kinoshita-san?

226
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,570
Ah, yes. What's his phone number?

227
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,220
Yes. Yes...

228
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,260
Yes. Thank you very much.

229
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,720
Yes. Good night.

230
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,250
Tomoya-kun?

231
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,600
They got a call from my pop's acquaintance.

232
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,590
I wonder what it could be about.

233
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,900
Yes, this is Kinoshita.

234
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,690
Hi, this is Okazaki.

235
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,990
Oh, Tomoya-kun? We've got some trouble!

236
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,680
Your father got arrested by the police.

237
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,560
Apparently he was dealing with some dangerous stuff.

238
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,820
I heard the story and figured I had to get in contact with you.

239
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,160
It's a small city, so rumors spread fast, too.

240
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:41,380
Sorry, but they want to cancel the deal.

241
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,540
I see.

242
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,750
But of course, continue to work here like you have been.

243
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,980
I guess things just happened at a bad time.

244
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,010
Keep yourself together.

245
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,410
Nagisa.

246
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,530
Yes?

247
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,870
Do you want to leave this city together?

248
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,220
I realized from this event.

249
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,520
I'm cursed by him.

250
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,710
I want to do things over in a place where his curse won't reach me.

251
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,150
I...

252
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,780
I won't.

253
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,800
That's just running away!

254
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,300
You can't run away from something like this.

255
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,630
I want you to make me have a happy life...

256
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,220
...in this city.

257
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,380
I can make that happen away from this city!

258
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,420
You won't say that I'm all you need?

259
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,540
I would go anywhere if you're there.

260
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,210
But we have to leave this city on a positive note if we are leaving.

261
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,060
Otherwise, this place won't become a place to come back to.

262
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,650
This is the city we were born.

263
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,090
It's our city.

264
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,640
Even if there's nothing good about this place?

265
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,760
I had lots of good things.

266
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,710
The best is that I met you.

267
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,890
You...

268
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,120
What do you want to do?!

269
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,730
Is it fun ruining other people's lives?

270
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,020
I don't consider you my parent.

271
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,710
But the society doesn't think that.

272
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,330
I'm your son.

273
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,390
You don't even feel like saying anything?

274
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,090
Don't you have anything to say to your son who you've caused so many problems for?

275
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,130
Stop mocking me!

276
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,330
Tomoya-kun!

277
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,520
That's enough. I've got nothing more to say to him.

278
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,610
Live like that forever!

279
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,390
Tomoya-kun.

280
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,180
Tomoya-kun.

281
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,530
Please wait!

282
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,670
What are you doing?!

283
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,430
You can't!

284
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,230
Tomoya-kun!

285
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,980
Tomoya-kun!

286
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,670
Does your hand hurt?

287
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,040
Yeah.

288
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,080
I'm sure it'll sting when you get in the bath.

289
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,630
I bet.

290
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,260
Nagisa.

291
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,110
Yes?

292
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,210
Let's get married.

293
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,590
Yes.

294
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,120
Are you sure?

295
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,900
I've always been thinking that you're the only one.

296
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,030
I'm a guy like this!

297
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,170
I'm a real pathetic...

298
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,010
I am, too.

299
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:58,160
But if we're together, we can become strong.

300
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,840
Will you always be with me?

301
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,560
Yes.

302
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,180
I will always be with you.

303
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,990
No matter when.

304
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,430
No matter how long.

305
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,820
I'm sorry for worrying you.

306
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,100
Please! No one was bothered by it.

307
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,180
Neither Nagisa, me, nor Akio-san was.

308
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,660
But society is.

309
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,920
As proof, I lost a position due to this.

310
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,250
But there's more than one path to take.

311
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,100
He really is like me.

312
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,490
I was frantic to become an adult.

313
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,220
And I was still just a kid then, too.
