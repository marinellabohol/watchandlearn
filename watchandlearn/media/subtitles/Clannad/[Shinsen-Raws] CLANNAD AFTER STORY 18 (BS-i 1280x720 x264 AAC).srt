2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,510
Do you want to walk...

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,200
...to a place where it's warm and there's lots of fun things?

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,880
That's what you want, right?

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,500
Okay.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,530
Then, let's go.

7
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,060
Hey Mom, look.

8
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,600
Hey, Mom.

9
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,180
Um.

10
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,230
What?

11
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,350
Play with me.

12
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,650
What do you play with Sanae-san?

13
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,530
Read books.

14
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,320
Did you bring one?

15
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,030
How about with the old man?

16
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,160
Baseball.

17
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,620
Baseball?

18
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,330
Yup. Look.

19
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,920
Komada.

20
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,540
Imitations?

21
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,000
It's not funny?

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,250
No, it's not.

23
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,800
Too bad.

24
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,090
What is that old man teaching?

25
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,180
Mom! Mom, listen!

26
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,980
Come on, sit down.

27
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,350
No!

28
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,980
Mom! Mom!

29
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,150
Be quiet. You're embarrassing yourself.

30
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,610
It's because you're not listening to me!

31
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,480
Keep it down!

32
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,070
Think about those around you a little!

33
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,440
Mom...

34
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,240
Yes.

35
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,780
We're sorry.

36
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,320
Damn it.

37
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,580
Ushio?

38
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,580
Where did she go?

39
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,260
God...

40
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,380
Hey. If you're going to the bathroom, say something.

41
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,890
What's wrong?

42
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,270
Were you crying?

43
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,270
Don't lie.

44
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,810
She said no crying.

45
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Who did?

46
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,860
Sanae-san.

47
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,240
She did?

48
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,280
She's unexpectedly strict.

49
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,780
But she said there are places I can cry.

50
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,240
Where are they?

51
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,120
Bathroom.

52
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,630
Yeah, I guess you can cry without anyone noticing in the bathroom.

53
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,630
I think you can cry when you want to cry.

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,890
It's better to cry now.

55
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:12,140
There are many times where you can't cry
even when you want to when you grow up.

56
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,320
Hey.

57
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,160
Do you want a toy?

58
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,450
Choose something.

59
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,370
I'll buy it for you.

60
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay.

61
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,170
Hey.

62
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,630
How's this?

63
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,140
Okay.

64
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,180
Don't force yourself.

65
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,940
You would have preferred a girlier toy, right?

66
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,900
Nuh-uh.

67
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,320
I wanted this.

68
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,900
I like this.

69
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,280
You have a strange taste, you know?

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,990
Nothing. Keep playing with it.

71
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,660
Okay.

72
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,790
I wonder if it's a fun summer vacation for her.

73
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,750
Of course not; not when she's with me.

74
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,430
What's wrong?

75
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,970
Bathroom.

76
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,560
Poop.

77
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,430
It's dark, so be careful.

78
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,060
Okay.

79
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,200
I did it myself.

80
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,290
Now what?

81
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,410
What's that?

82
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,170
It's a firefly.

83
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,210
You know about those, right?

84
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,460
First time seeing one.

85
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,340
I guess those from here
come out later than others.

86
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,590
What?

87
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,760
Nothing.

88
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,810
Is there something on my face?

89
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,890
No.

90
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,640
Then don't stare at other people's faces like that.

91
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,190
What is it?

92
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,360
You have something you want to say, don't you?

93
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,030
What? Are you still scared of me?

94
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,320
All right. Say it.

95
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,700
I won't yell any more.

96
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,580
Okay.

97
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,040
Tell me about Mommy.

98
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,170
Ask Sanae-san.

99
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,590
She won't tell me even if I ask her.

100
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,670
She wants me to tell you, eh?

101
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,810
Ask Sanae-san. Tell her that I didn't tell you.

102
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,580
Ushio.

103
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,620
Don't fall asleep.

104
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,540
There.

105
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,750
Wear your hat properly.

106
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,630
We have a lot of walking today.

107
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,720
Let's go.

108
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,380
Yeah.

109
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,530
Wow...

110
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,360
Want to have a better look?

111
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,370
I do!

112
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,410
All right.

113
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,450
There, spread your legs.

114
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,290
Wow, you're light.

115
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,460
There!

116
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,460
How is it?

117
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,050
Wow!

118
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,560
Don't run off too far!

119
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,230
I guess it was good to come.

120
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,560
Hey!

121
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,750
What's wrong?

122
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,040
I lost it.

123
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,130
Lost what?

124
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,840
Robot.

125
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,430
It's nowhere.

126
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,970
You didn't go any further, right?

127
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,640
Ya.

128
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,140
Strange. You didn't cover much ground.

129
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,270
Ushio, let's give up.

130
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,820
Just buy the same one on the way back.

131
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,480
Okay?

132
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,070
I want that one.

133
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,110
We can't find it, so there's nothing we can do.

134
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,660
You're so stubborn.

135
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,930
Ushio!

136
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,020
I'm going to take a walk that way. Don't move from here, okay?

137
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,730
Okay.

138
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,280
What is this?

139
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,950
I know this place?

140
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,600
You're Okazaki Tomoya-san, right?

141
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,930
Ah... yes. You know me?

142
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,060
Yes. I know of you.

143
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,230
My name is Okazaki Shino.

144
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,980
Okazaki?

145
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,860
I'm your father's, Okazaki Naoyuki's, mother.

146
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,960
I received a call from Furukawa-san.

147
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,420
They said you'd come if I waited here.

148
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,420
Was it Sanae-san?

149
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,710
You've really grown.

150
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,130
We've met before?

151
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,470
Right here, when you were still little.

152
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,850
It was after your mother, Atsuko-san, passed away.

153
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,900
Is Naoyuki still atoning for his sin?

154
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,530
No. He should've been released and be living at home by now.

155
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,870
I'm sure you experienced many emotions.

156
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,580
Not much.

157
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,460
He was not always that foolish.

158
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,380
Both Atsuko-san and Naoyuki were still students, so people were opposed to their marriage,

159
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,680
but Naoyuki quit high school and started living in a small apartment with her.

160
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,930
Regardless, it seemed he was having a great life.

161
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,440
To live protecting the one he loved.

162
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,940
That's all it took to make him happy.

163
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,490
Soon, Atsuko-san was pregnant with you,

164
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,580
and you were born, treasured by everyone.

165
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,840
But the happy life didn't last long.

166
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,300
Atsuko-san passed away in an accident.

167
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:30,100
To him, it was an event too sad to recover from.

168
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,940
But he couldn't let himself fall into the depths of despair.

169
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,860
Tomoya-san.

170
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,120
He still had you to care for.

171
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,040
He said he would raise you to be a man.

172
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,710
That day, you walked away from here holding hands.

173
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,130
Do you remember?

174
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,600
The days after that were the days he worked the hardest in his life.

175
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,520
He was fired from many jobs
and went from one place to another.

176
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,440
Even then, he worked with you in his care.

177
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,030
He would buy you toys with the little money he had and give you snacks.

178
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,080
He sacrificed all his luck and chances for success.

179
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,460
At times, he might have been strict or violent,

180
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,710
but it was all to raise you well.

181
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:51,810
However, for Naoyuki, it was a very hard life.

182
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,020
To relieve the pain from work, he indulged in alcohol.

183
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,900
I heard there were times he was drunk and out of control.

184
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,440
Even so, he chose to live with you.

185
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:17,960
And, by the time you had grown and could choose your own way, Naoyuki had lost everything.

186
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,590
Work, faith, luck, friends. Everything.

187
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,720
I heard you're in a situation similar to his right now.

188
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,550
It is a painful situation.

189
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:38,560
But that's why I wanted let you hear this story.

190
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,150
I wanted you to know what kind of father Naoyuki was.

191
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,860
He often bought me snacks.

192
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,740
Also, going on walks, holding hands.

193
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,250
Why did I forget all this?

194
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,250
Tomoya-san. Do you think Naoyuki was a bad father?

195
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,670
No.

196
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,670
I'm an even worse man than him.

197
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,180
I'm standing at the same place Pops stood that day.

198
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,560
Yet I'm weak...

199
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,770
I'm pathetic.

200
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,190
So is he.

201
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,650
He's weak, pathetic, and clumsy.

202
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,490
Still, he did his best for you.

203
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,660
I want to hold him as my pride and joy.

204
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,250
He had many failures as a person,

205
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,460
but I believe that he was a fine father.

206
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:50,970
Me, too.

207
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,340
I agree.

208
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,470
I think so, too.

209
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,310
Thank you very much.

210
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,810
I feel relieved.

211
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,370
Tomoya-san. He tried too hard.

212
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,000
It's about time he can rest.

213
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,460
Can you tell Naoyuki to come home?

214
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,970
I will be waiting for him here.

215
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,390
Ushio.

216
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,060
Did you find it?

217
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,440
That's your child?

218
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,480
Yes. She's Ushio.

219
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,330
You've been searching all this time?

220
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,080
Yup.

221
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:01,830
I see.

222
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,210
Ushio.

223
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,010
We might not be able to find that robot.

224
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,640
We can't do anything about it.

225
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,850
So let's buy another one.

226
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:21,470
Okay?

227
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,230
There's only one.

228
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,270
There were lots of them at the store.

229
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,740
It's the one you chose and bought for me.

230
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,450
First thing from Daddy.

231
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,670
Ushio.

232
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,550
Were you lonely?

233
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,010
Yup.

234
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,720
Was it fun to come on a trip with me?

235
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,220
Yup.

236
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,640
I see.

237
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,350
Ushio... would it be all right if I stayed with you?

238
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,940
I've been a bad daddy for many years,

239
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,450
but I'll do my best for you from now on.

240
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,990
So, would it be all right if I stayed with you?

241
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,240
Yup.

242
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,830
Really?

243
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,620
I want you to be with me.

244
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,250
I see.

245
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,840
But today, I lost an important thing, so I'm sad.

246
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:38,930
Daddy.

247
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,550
You know...

248
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:52,270
Is it all right not to hold it in anymore?

249
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,980
Sanae-san told me.

250
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,860
Places I can cry are in the bathroom...

251
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,450
...and in Daddy's arms.

252
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,160
Yeah...

253
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,790
Yeah!

254
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,730
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,730
I'm sorry.

256
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,020
I'm so sorry.

257
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,710
Hey, Ushio.

258
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,330
Do you want to hear about Mommy?

259
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:56,960
Yup.

260
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,340
All right. Then come here.

261
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,930
Let's see...

262
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,610
Mommy was a crybaby.

263
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,280
Even the first time we met.
She wasn't sure of herself and was weak.

264
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,700
She stood still at the foot of the hill to school.

265
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,780
Guess what she said at the foot of the hill?

266
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,250
She closed her eyes and said, "Sweet bean bread."

267
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,290
That was Mommy's habit.

268
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,840
Saying something she wanted to eat out loud to gather her courage.

269
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,970
Sanae-san was really busy at the time and didn't have the time to make Mommy's bento.

270
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,480
Maybe she could have if she'd tried,
but Mommy said not to.

271
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,600
That's what Mommy was like.

272
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,190
Then...

273
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,360
Ah... then...

274
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,240
And then...

275
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,740
Mommy was...

276
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,750
Nagisa...

277
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,460
Nagisa...

278
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,220
Nagisa...

279
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,350
Daddy...

280
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,810
Why are you crying, too?

281
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:41,270
Sorry. I was remembering Mommy.

282
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,410
All right, let's keep going.

283
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,410
Mommy wanted to do theater at the time.

284
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,370
Nagisa. I found it.

285
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,370
Do you know what theater is?

286
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,460
I finally found it.

287
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,670
Something only I can protect.

288
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,010
The precious thing only I can protect.

289
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,970
It was...

290
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,770
...right here.

291
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,030
We're back.

292
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,740
Welcome back.

293
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,790
A guy that used to have eyes of a dead fish is up and about.

294
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,960
You like the Big Dango Family, too?

295
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,920
Sanae-san said this is how Mommy smelled.

296
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,760
I'm home.
