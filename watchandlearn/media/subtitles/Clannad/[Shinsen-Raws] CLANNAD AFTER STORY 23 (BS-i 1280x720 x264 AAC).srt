2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,520
Yay! We're in the same class again!

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,070
Yuck. Minoshima's my
homeroom teacher? This sucks.

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,910
3-D...

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,340
Good morning, Furukawa-san.

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,590
Kimura-san. Good morning.

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,140
Looks like we're in different classes.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,280
So you're in class D...

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,730
Do you see anyone we were with last year?

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,020
No one among the girls.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,390
I see.

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,260
I'm sure you'll make new friends soon.

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,960
You're cute, after all.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,400
I-I don't think that's true, but...

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,620
Don't be so shy and go talk to others.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,030
I'm in class A, so see you.

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,580
Yes.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,670
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,120
Yeah.

20
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Sign: Welcome New Students

21
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,120
Why is this the first thing we do as juniors?

22
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,830
That's because we screwed up escaping from class.

23
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,420
You guys!

24
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,590
I can't take this.

25
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm the one who can't take this!

26
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,680
Why the heck do I have to keep my eyes on you guys?!

27
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,900
You should have just let us go, then.

28
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,560
We're here because you turned us-

29
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,280
That's called undue resentment!

30
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,360
If you don't know the term, want me to crack open your skull and hammer it into your brain?

31
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,780
Your eyes are serious.

32
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,700
This is why I didn't want to accept being the class representative!

33
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,540
Then let's finish this and go back.

34
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,460
None of us wants to waste time doing this.

35
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,380
What was your name again?

36
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,460
Okazaki Tomoya.

37
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,300
What's yours?

38
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,840
I don't have a name to tell delinquents.

39
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,060
I said my name, so you tell yours, too!

40
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,100
Never. I don't want to acquaint myself with idiots.

41
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,440
You have a wonderful personality.

42
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,520
Hey, looks like you have an eye for people.

43
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,780
Do you at least want permission to talk to me?

44
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,400
There you go again!

45
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,070
You idiot!

46
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,200
H-Hey, keep off.

47
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,370
I saved you, and you're giving me that?

48
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,130
Hey, I'm not all right, you know.

49
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,510
It's iffy if you deserve a word of gratitude or not, but I'll give you my thanks this time.

50
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,550
You'd better be grateful.

51
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,390
I'm Fujibayashi Kyou.

52
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,310
I'll be with you guys for a year,
but don't trouble me too much, you hear?

53
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,730
Fujibayashi?

54
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,480
There was another Fujibayashi
in the next class over, wasn't there?

55
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,980
That's my twin sister.

56
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,450
It's confusing, so just call me Kyou.

57
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,570
Bye.

58
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,700
We got to know a strange girl.

59
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,370
I bet she's thinking the same thing.

60
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,790
Hey, what should we do now?

61
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,670
Let's hang out by the train station.

62
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,040
We've got nothing else to do, anyway.

63
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,960
You're right.

64
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,260
I'm back.

65
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,760
Hey, welcome.

66
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
How's the new class?

67
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,140
I couldn't talk with anyone, so I was a little lonely.

68
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,020
Why don't you just dive in?

69
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,810
Go introduce yourself.

70
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,770
Hello? Yeah, it's me. Me.

71
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,440
Ah? I'm Nagisa, your granddaughter.

72
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,860
I got in an accident, and I'm in a little trouble...

73
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,990
Do at least something like this!

74
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,870
That's a little different.

75
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,990
I'm saying you need
a determination on that level.

76
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,290
Be proactive! Proactive!

77
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:00,670
Even as a junior, it took me a lot of time to become friends with my classmates.

78
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,500
It looks like it'll take time this time, too.

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,920
All it takes is giving it chance.

80
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,470
Everyone around you wants to make friends fast, too.

81
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,550
You're right.

82
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,600
Chance it is.

83
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,770
All right. I'll teach you a special trick.

84
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,730
You know how embarrassing it is to call your teacher "mother" by mistake, right?

85
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,030
You adapt that and call
the teacher, "Mother of Ultra"!

86
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,530
Then a rumor starts to go around.

87
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,700
Could Furukawa-san be related to the Ultramen?

88
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,490
I wonder if she can transform.

89
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,950
Let's ask her.

90
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,500
Hey, Furukawa-san, do you want to eat lunch together?

91
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,460
I think that's too hard to accomplish.

92
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,670
Then how about sharing this with the class?

93
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,710
Mom's bread?

94
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,760
There must be someone willing to suffer through eating this.

95
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,800
Talk to kind people like that.

96
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,970
Though, I think that's too much to ask.

97
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,020
So my bread was... my bread was...

98
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,020
...too much to ask for?!

99
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,110
I...

100
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,190
...love them!

101
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,910
I'll now explain tomorrow's entrance ceremony.

102
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,250
First, the juniors and seniors will sit in the gym,

103
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,250
then the freshmen will enter.

104
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,500
After the ceremony, freshmen have orientation.

105
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,090
Juniors and seniors will start their classes.

106
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,260
The freshmen will-

107
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,140
Mother of Ultra!

108
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,930
I have a question!

109
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,260
Furukawa-san, you're related to Ultraman?

110
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,930
So cool!

111
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,140
Can you show us your transformation?

112
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,940
Oh, I made a mistake.

113
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,110
Sorry to be so clumsy.

114
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,320
Make sure you don't scare them by recruiting for clubs too aggressively.

115
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,540
Also, refrain from doing welcome events other than those organized by the school.

116
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,630
This guy...

117
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,920
Wake up, Okazaki!

118
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,930
Fifth period's about to start.

119
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,390
God...

120
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,520
I guess he belongs to the cool-looking side, now that I take a close look.

121
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,150
I wonder if he has a girlfriend.

122
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,400
Okazaki, watch out!

123
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,700
Su-Sunohara. What do you want?

124
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,450
What were you doing?

125
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,780
Were you trying to kill him while he's asleep?

126
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,410
Or, were you trying to screw around with him in the guy-girl relationship sense?

127
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,370
Of course not!

128
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,170
Are you sure?

129
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,170
Weren't you thinking something like, "Hey, he's pretty good looking"?

130
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,590
He looks like a total retard, but he's pretty sharp.

131
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,390
A punch erases memory, right?

132
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,800
Where is this coming from?!

133
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,640
Shut up! What's with the commotion?!

134
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,480
Okazaki!

135
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,520
You were in danger, you know?!

136
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,110
You were about to be in a guy-girl rela-

137
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,690
Erasing memory, accomplished.

138
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,490
Furukawa-san!

139
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,700
Kimura-san.

140
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,040
Finally caught up.

141
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,080
Are you alone?

142
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,960
Yes.

143
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,840
I got to know her in my new class.

144
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,300
We're going to go check out some clothes; do you want to come with us?

145
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,550
Me?

146
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,760
Furukawa-san's a really funny person, you know?

147
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,850
Come on, let's go.

148
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,560
But it's not good to linger on the way home.

149
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,100
No one cares about that kind of stuff nowadays.

150
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,230
Here, let's go.

151
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,030
It looks cute!

152
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,780
She's right. You look nice, Furukawa-san.

153
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
I'm so nervous.

154
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,120
If a teacher finds us, we'll get yelled at.

155
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Next, try this dress.

156
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,290
Okay...

157
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,840
Oh no, Furukawa-san!
A teacher's on patrol here!

158
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,050
We're going to make our run, so good luck!

159
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,350
Please wait! Please don't do that!

160
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,980
I... Even if you wish me luck...

161
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
I'm sorry, Sensei!

162
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,650
Just kidding.

163
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,320
We're sorry about that.
You were so funny, we couldn't resist.

164
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,870
It's fine. Though it scared me a little.

165
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,950
Such a waste.

166
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,290
You're such a fun person, yet nobody realizes it.

167
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,420
It'll be nice if you can make friends in your class soon.

168
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,340
Yes.

169
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,880
See you!

170
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,380
Good bye, Furukawa-san.

171
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,970
Like that, I was with Kimura-san
on the way home, so it was fun, but...

172
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,310
But you're alone in the class like always.

173
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,480
Yes.

174
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,900
Thirty people packed in a small class, so there ought to be one person you can get along with.

175
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:23,620
Even among those you pass in the hallway may be a friend forever or your soulmate.

176
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,410
But without action,
they're forever no one to you.

177
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,700
How should I take action?

178
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,120
This comes into action!

179
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,250
Bread made by Sanae is mixed in this.

180
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,090
Give this to the class and enjoy the surprise.

181
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,630
Same as those pranks you see at parties.

182
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,840
It's bound to start a conversation.

183
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,850
Furukawa-san, you come up with the funniest ideas.

184
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,770
I want to be friends with you.

185
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,810
Just like that.

186
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,610
So my bread was... my bread was...

187
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,610
...something meant to be enjoyed as a surprise?!

188
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,110
I...

189
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,450
...love them!

190
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,540
Six of Spades and Eight of Hearts.

191
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,410
And, Nine of Spades.

192
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,460
"6" and "9" come together and make the shape of "8", so...

193
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,260
Your fortune-telling method's completely original as always.

194
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,510
Onee-chan, you'll be asked out by someone tomorrow.

195
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,970
Asked out?

196
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,260
The person will say, "I like you".

197
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,220
From some nice boy.

198
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,730
I think we need to let her know how terrifying we are.

199
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,900
What? Going to pick a fight?

200
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,820
We're taking a much smarter path!

201
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,570
"Dear Fujibayashi Kyou-sama."

202
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,330
"I fell in love with you the other day and want to confess my love to you,"

203
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,500
"so please come to the reference room in the old building during lunch."

204
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,870
"See you there."

205
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,000
We're going to put that in her shoe locker tomorrow.

206
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,210
When her heart's pounding and all,
we'll watch her and laugh.

207
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,840
This is my first time seeing a love letter with "I'm stupid" written all over.

208
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,180
With this, Fujibayashi Kyou will be shocked and won't be able to stand tall again.

209
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,980
We'll be able to enjoy the remaining year!

210
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,560
True, a terror will be waiting. In many ways.

211
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,360
Right?

212
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,070
I can't wait for tomorrow to come.

213
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,110

215
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,080
I'm the person on duty,
so I'm going to head up.

216
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,700
Yeah, see you later.

217
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,630
"Dear Fujibayashi Kyou-sama."

218
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,760
No way! Ryou's fortune-telling's right?!

219
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,060
Look at her blush.

220
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,520
She can be pretty cute.

221
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,270
I think we're doing something really sick.

222
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,230
Look, look, that boy's cute.

223
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,940
What? You're setting targets now?

224
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,990
I wonder how many we'll get into our club.

225
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,830
Yeah. It would be nice if we could get at least two.

226
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,450
Good morning.

227
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,410
Look, he's well-built.

228
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,250
Hey, that boy with the round face. Doesn't he resemble that?

229
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,210
You know, that thing that was popular a few years back.

230
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,380
The mascot character.

231
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,880
What was it called?

232
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,880
Something like this.

233
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,930
Ah, what was it...

234
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,640
I can't remember it, either.

235
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,470
It was pretty popular, wasn't it?
With lots of dolls and such getting sold?

236
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,770
Um, that's...

237
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,770
All right, we're going to the gym now.

New students, I hope you will have three wonderful years here.

240
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,170
Next, salutation from the new students.

241
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,270
Hey, am I actually looking forward to meeting the guy?

242
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,620
"There has been a little mishap. Please come to the rooftop."

243
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,760
"I'm sorry. Please come to the gym storage room after all."

244
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,260
What is this guy thinking?

245
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,100
You better quit it soon.

246
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,860
Why? You can't find something this funny that often.

247
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,570
Mother of Ultra.

248
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,530
Mother of Ultra.

249
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,620
Wow. She still doesn't realize she's being messed with.

250
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,960
Let's quit it already.

251
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,790
It's gone too far.

252
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,670
This is only the beginning.

253
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,210
Got to go ahead of her.

254
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,720
You better make this it.

255
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,260
I know.

256
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,850
There has been another mishap, so this time-

257
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,850
Where should I make her go this time?

258
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,520
How about, "I'll be waiting for you in Hell"?

259
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,400
Hell?

260
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,360
Hey, nice idea.

261
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,400
I like that scary sound.

262
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,570
I'm glad it's to your liking.

263
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,580
I thought I was really getting sent to Hell.

264
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,670
So, why are we doing something like this again?

265
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,130
We're going to trick the freshmen to unwind.

266
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,590
Taking it out on others?

267
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,970
What should I write?

268
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,310
"Sunohara, Okazaki,
the friendly team. By Howdy."

269
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,480
How's that sound?

270
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,520
We'll use difficult kanji to write howdy like punks do.

271
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,610
There were several things I could point out, but nonetheless, won't.

272
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,740
Then, "Youhei-Tomoya, the best. By Howdy."

273
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,160
So you know, "by" goes before the names.

274
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,740
In that case,

275
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:50,420
"Sunohara, Okazaki, the friendly team and Euro extreme ironing, feat. Hikarizaka Bros. By Howdy."

276
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,000
It's sounds confusing now.

277
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,710
Then you write it.

278
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,430
When this breaks, that falls out, right?

279
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,220
Yeah. We're going to drill into them that high school life's not easy.

280
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,600
Then this the best word of advice I can give them.

281
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,690
Sign: Welcome New Students

282
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,270
What's that?

283
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,530
It's too suspicious,
no matter how you look at it.

284
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,150
Why don't you pull it?

285
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,820
No way. I don't want to get soaked.

286
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,490
No one's falling for it.

287
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,370
Only a moron falls for that.

288
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,380
Damn it. You mean they're smarter than me?

289
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,630
Heck, you're the lowest of all.

290
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,550
Hey.

291
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,510
Is she a freshman?

292
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,850
The collar's blue, so she must be a senior.

293
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,690
Oh no. She's knocked out.

294
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,730
Health center! Take her to the health center!

295
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,820
Hey, Okazaki...

296
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,110
Yeah, there was a moron.

297
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,740
Furukawa-san, are you all right?

298
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,210
Yes. But my head still hurts.

299
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,500
It was someone's prank.

300
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,590
I was right behind you.

301
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,010
Note: The Drifters is an old comedy group who used the falling metal tub routine often

302
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,010
It was like a scene from
the Drifters and I laughed.

303
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,630
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,390
I'm totally fine.

305
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,350
I've wanted to have a chat with you for a while.

306
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,650
I heard from Kimura-san that you're a nice person.

307
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,650
From Kimura-san?

308
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,740
I'm happy that I finally have a chance.

309
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,910
Could you be my friend if that's all right?

310
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,410
Yes! But I'm...

311
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,380
Me, too. Let's be friends.

312
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,250
Great, thank you.

313
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,770
Could being a kindergarten teacher be as tiring as this?

314
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,520
Did something happen?

315
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,940
There's a pain in my class that causes nothing but trouble.

316
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,270
Every day is a workout.

317
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,110
But you don't look like you mind.

318
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,610
Yeah, I guess I don't mind it much.

319
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,280
Hey, haven't your breasts grown again?

320
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,290
What are you doing this time?

321
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,880
Love Letter Mission 2.

322
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:26,800
This time, I'm pretending to be
a freshman falling in love at first sight.

323
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,930
We have so much time to waste, don't we?

324
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,520
It was my first time talking to her,
so I was a little nervous.

325
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,770

00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,780
Yes. But it's thanks to this.

329
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,830
