2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,890
The entire world is white.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,330
What am I doing here?

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,440
That's right. I've been here with her all this time.

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,950
I've been here with only her...

6
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,980
...in this sad world where there is nothing.

7
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,460
If this was going to happen,
I shouldn't have brought her out.

8
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,460
I only brought her suffering.

9
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,800
That's right.

10
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,260
I probably shouldn't have spoken to Nagisa at this moment.

11
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,310
If she hadn't met me, Nagisa wouldn't have...

12
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,360
Is this the end of our journey?

13
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,610
I didn't want it to be.

14
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,000
I didn't want her to go to sleep in such a cold place.

15
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,320
Hey.

16
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,950
You're there, right?

17
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,160
Of course. I'm always by your side.

18
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:53,870
Thank you.

19
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,540
Eh?

20
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,590
I can finally hear your voice.

21
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,260
You're right!

22
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,550
I soon won't be a human,
so I can hear your voice, too.

23
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,060
I was having a dream.

24
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,810
I learned a lot of things in it.

25
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,440
About myself. About you.

26
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,440
Will you listen to them?

27
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,020
Yeah.

28
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,900
You and I used to be in the same world.

29
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,860
We were very close, too. Long ago, though.

30
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,370
Actually, we might still be.

31
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,460
So we weren't supposed to be in this world, after all!

32
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,420
Let's go back together.

33
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,130
I'm sorry. I have to remain here.

34
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,460
Why?

35
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,680
Because, in this world, I am the world.

36
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,930
I don't understand! We promised!

37
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,060
We promised we'd leave this world together.

38
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,440
If I leave this world, this world will disappear.

39
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,190
Then many lights would meet misery.

40
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,280
Lights?

41
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,740
You mean all those lights that were flying?

42
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,870
Yes. Those are feelings from people in the other world.

43
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,830
You were one of the lights, too.

44
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,710
The world that is furthest,
yet the world that is closest.

45
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,630
We've always been there.

46
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,720
Yes, we came from the same place.

47
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,090
We only see things differently.

48
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,680
Another world? Is an alternate me there?

49
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,020
You should be able to tell,

50
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,020
since you exist in both worlds.

51
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,030
We were able to meet despite the differences in the world.

52
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,400
That's enough to make me content.

53
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:55,580
You will soon fall asleep in this world and wake up in the other world.

54
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,790
You'll meet many people,
and many things will happen.

55
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,830
Then you'll eventually meet me.

56
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,960
I'll be able to see you again?

57
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,460
In the other world?

58
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,260
Like we can see people's feelings from the other world as light in this world,

59
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,720
my feelings will become many lights in that world and shimmer.

60
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:24,480
Each light may be very faint, but gathered together they should become a strong force.

61
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,990
I know that song.

62
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,750
Yes. It's the song you always sang for me.

63
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,930
Good bye, Daddy.

64
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Nagisa!!!

65
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,630
Nagisa!

66
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Nagisa!

67
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm right here!

68
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,890
Tomoya-kun.

69
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,150
I'm glad you stopped me.

70
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,190
Nagisa...

71
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:55,030
I was really worried you might be thinking that you should have never met me.

72
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,120
I'm glad that I met you.

73
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,420
I had a wonderful life.

74
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,290
Nagisa.

75
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,420
So please. Don't lose yourself.

76
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:18,390
No matter what may await,
please don't regret meeting me.

77
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,060
Is that too much to ask?

78
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,150
You're right...

79
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,110
Thank you.

80
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,690
Would you like me to take you?

81
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,110
To a place in this city where wishes come true.

82
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,910
It's coming to an end...

83
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,290
...The long, long journey...

84
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,260
Nagisa?

85
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,680
Nagisa...

86
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,640
Nagisa...

87
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,070
Tomoya-kun.

88
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,820
Nagisa!

89
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,450
Is something wrong, Tomoya-kun?

90
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,000
We were just together, weren't we?

91
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,420
We're always together.

92
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,090
We said that we'd always be.

93
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,420
Yeah, you're right.

94
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,470
Okazaki-san.

95
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,140
Both the baby and your wife are safe now.

96
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,730
You've done a great job.

97
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,100
You did great, too.

98
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,310
Thanks.

99
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,940
Tomoya-san.

100
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,610
Will you give Ushio her first bath?

101
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,410
Ah, yes!

102
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,200
Support the head with your right hand.

103
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,500
Plug the ears so the water doesn't get in.

104
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,960
Yes, slowly.

105
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,710
There, doesn't it feel good?

106
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,210
Don't dip the head in yet.

107
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,260
Wipe it with the gauze.

108
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,050
Ushio-chan, isn't it great to be washed by your Daddy?

109
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,390
Great job, Tomoya-kun.

110
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,470
She's a very active baby.

111
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,100
I hope she'll continue to be active even after she grows.

112
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,060
Don't worry!

113
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,650
She'll be a strong girl, in both body and mind.

114
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,730
We'll make sure of that!

115
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,940
Yes.

116
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,740
Tomoya-kun. Take a look outside the window.

117
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,950
It's very beautiful.

118
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,920
You mean the snow?

119
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,130
No, this is...

120
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,600
Dango, dango, dango, dango.

121
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,310
Dango, a great big dango family.

122
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:00,190
Dango, dango, dango, dango.

123
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,570
A great big dango family.

124
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:12,330
If a city has a heart and a mind like people do,

125
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:19,710
and if it's trying to make the people living in it as happy as possible,

I think I finally understand, too.

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:41,480
Seasons have gone by and a cold wind blows.

167
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:41,480
季節は移り　もう冷たい風が

168
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:41,480
Kisetsu ha utsuri mou tsumetai kaze ga

169
00:14:43,270 --> 00:15:00,500
Sleep within that song sung by the spring.

170
00:14:43,270 --> 00:15:00,500
Tsutsumarete nemure ano haru no uta no naka de

171
00:14:43,270 --> 00:15:00,500
包まれて眠れ　あの春の歌の中で

172
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:11,090
Chiisana te nimo itsukaraka bokura oikoshiteku tsuyosa

173
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:11,090
In the small hand is the strength to pass us one day.

174
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:11,090
小さな手にもいつからか僕ら追い越してく強さ

175
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:20,850
Nureta hoho niha doredake no egao ga utsutta

176
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:20,850
Many wet cheeks were sacrificed for smiles.

177
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:20,850
濡れた頬にはどれだけの笑顔が映った

178
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:30,280
Chiisana te demo hanarete mo bokura ha kono michi yukunda

179
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:30,280
Even when the small hand leaves us,
we will continue on our way.

180
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:30,280
小さな手でも離れても僕らはこの道ゆくんだ

181
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:40,080
When the special day comes, we will save it as a memory.

182
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:40,080
そして来る日は僕らも思い出を仕舞った

183
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:40,080
Soshite kuru hi ha bokura mo omoide wo shimatta

184
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:49,460
The small hand will eventually pass us.

185
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:49,460
小さな手でもいつの日か僕ら追い越してゆくんだ

186
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:49,460
Chiisana te demo itsuno hika bokura oikoshite yukunda

187
00:15:49,590 --> 00:16:03,900
Yagate kuru hi ha atarashii kisetsu wo hiraita

188
00:15:49,590 --> 00:16:03,900
The special day is the start of a new season.

189
00:15:49,590 --> 00:16:03,900
やがて来る日は新しい季節を開いた

190
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,840
Don't be so upset.

191
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,890
Fuko is very upset.

192
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,600
That person was very rude.

193
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,810
Fuko isn't a grade school kid.

194
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,140
You're very small, so you can't blame them for the mistake.

195
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,610
Even if Fuko's small, Fuko wants them to sense the adult aura Fuko gives off.

196
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,950
You're not giving that off as much as you think.

197
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,950
That really stabbed into Fuko's heart.

198
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,120
Fuko's really hurt.

199
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,250
Fuko's been tainted!

200
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,160
Don't say strange things.

201
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,250
Fuko's an adult!

202
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,040
Oh, maybe it's that.

203
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,630
How you speak in the third person may be the reason people see you as a child.

204
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,010
How should Fuko speak then?

205
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,760
"Me"?

206
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,100
You know, me's already mature enough.

207
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,140
Like that?

208
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,100
That was so illicit sounding!

209
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,480
Don't jab at your own action.

210
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,730
Just say "I" like everyone else does.

211
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,780
"I"?

212
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,070
You know, I'm already mature enough.

213
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,240
Like that?

214
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,370
That was so illicit sounding!

215
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,620
I think it would sound illicit no matter how you say it so long as it's that line.

216
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,040
Fuko's hungry.

217
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,830
So you've given up already, eh?

218
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,790
Fuko wants to go to a family restaurant.

219
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,340
Let's go after the check up.

220
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,130
There's nothing wrong with Fuko anymore.

221
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,970
So we're going now!

222
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,590
No!

223
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,310
If we don't hurry,
the hamburgers will be sold out.

224
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,730
There are plenty, so don't worry.

225
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:11,310
They would be gone if everyone had been ordering only hamburgers starting a week ago.

226
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,980
Such a coincidence can't happen, so don't worry.

227
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,400
There, we're almost at the hospital.

228
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,490
If the hamburgers are sold out,
I'll make one for you.

229
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,450
Will it be served on an iron plate
so it won't get cold?

230
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,240
It will, it will.

231
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,120
Then okay.

232
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,500
Besides, even if you're physically all right,
we need to periodically check your health.

233
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:39,340
I'll be at ease if they tell me that you're doing well.

234
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,050
Okay?

235
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,050
Fuko's making you worry?

236
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,020
No, not that much.

237
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,810
Please dissect Fuko all you want
so you'll be at ease!

238
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,020
Fu-chan!

239
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,110
Onee-chan! You're a slow walker!

240
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,110
Let's move along!

241
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,030
Why is she like this?

242
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,080
What is it this time, Fu-chan?

243
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,750
Fuko can smell.

244
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,960
The smell of a hamburger?

245
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,210
Don't treat me the same as you!

246
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,840
I was trying to talk at the same level as you.

247
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,380
That was very rude of you.

248
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,850
Fuko will repeat, so please ask what Fuko smells.

249
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,050
Okay, okay.

250
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,810
Fuko can smell.

251
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,350
What do you smell?

252
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,980
This smell is...

253
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,940
It's a cute smell.

254
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,480
That's not really an answer.

255
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,820
Fuko was hoping you would catch the nuance.

256
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,070
Was it a riddle?

257
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,280
You're being rude. It's an art.

258
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,910
You're talking more nonsense again.

259
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,700
Do you realize what you're saying, Fu-chan?

260
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,660
You were a teacher,
so you're too much of a realist.

261
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,710
I was an art teacher.

262
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,580
Art.

263
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,420
You see?

264
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,380
Then please capture what Fuko says.

265
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,630
There's nothing to capture.

266
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,840
Okay...

267
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,300
Then Fuko will say it simply.

268
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,390
I'll repeat again, so ask Fuko what the smell is.

269
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,180
Okay.

270
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,890
Someone's there.

271
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,720
What?

272
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,350
That's not what you're supposed to say.

273
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,730
The statement changed.

274
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,810
I'm supposed to ask,
"What do you smell?" to that statement?

275
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,900
Yes.

276
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,360
That would make me a strange person.

277
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,320
Don't worry. Fuko will follow you up.

278
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,740
One more time.

279
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,780
Okay.

280
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,700
Someone's there.

281
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,410
What do you smell?

282
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,120
I'm sure she's here to meet me.

283
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,500
You didn't follow me up at all.

284
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,460
Why aren't you surprised?

285
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,300
Fuko said someone's here to meet Fuko.

286
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,510
I hope she'll make lots of friends.

287
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,470
One more time.

288
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,310
As you wish.

289
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,850
Someone's there.

290
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,310
What do you smell?

291
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,400
I'm sure she's here to meet me.

292
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,520
What do you mean?

293
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,730
It's a cute smell.

294
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,400
You're not making any sense.

295
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,450
She's sleeping there.

296
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,160
She's waiting to be woken up by someone.

297
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,330
So...

298
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,370
Fuko's off!

299
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,670
Fu-chan! Where are you going?

300
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,420
You should come fast if you want to meet her, too.

301
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,210
She's under that tree!

302
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,920
Is someone there?

303
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,590
Fuko doesn't know!

304
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,640
But she's a very cute girl!

305
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,010
Fu-chan!

306
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,510
Hey, Fu-chan!

307
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,180
Really, she's such a...

308
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,360
Are you there? It's Fuko.

309
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,460
What's your name?

310
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,540
Would you tell Fuko?

311
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,970
Let's be friends and play together.

312
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,260
The fun is only just about to begin.

313
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,870
Even as a junior, it took me a lot of time to become friends with my classmates.

314
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,620
So you're alone in the class like always.

315
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,000
I couldn't talk with anyone, so I was a little lonely.

316
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,880
It'll be nice if you can make friends in your class soon.

317
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,920
Yes.

318
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,180
It was my first time talking to him,
so I was a little nervous.

319
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,600
Okazaki Tomoya.

320
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,310
What's yours?
