2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,060
We began to build a vehicle that can fly.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,240
We'll leave this place with this...

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,740
...and we'll go to a more fun and livelier world.

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,840
If it gets cold, she won't be able to move.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,820
We have to hurry.

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,450
We worked without rest.

8
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,990
Are you done with
your parent-teacher conference?

9
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:31,620
Yes. And since I can't think of something I want to study at college, I'm thinking of finding a job.

10
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,250
And you've got good grades, too... What a waste.

11
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,460
What will you do once you graduate?

12
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,850
Hey... Is there anything you want as a present?

13
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,130
Is it related to graduation?

14
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,690
No, not really, but I suddenly felt the urge to give you something.

15
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,230
You're trying to change the subject again.

16
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,580
I can't accept a present for no reason.

17
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,850
Isn't wanting to give something to
your loved one a good enough reason?

18
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,790
If that was true, then I'd have to give you something every day.

19
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,720
Anyway, if we stick to these rules,

20
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,260
then gift exchanges would happen only on birthdays and at Christmas.

21
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,510
In this case, I'd have only one day to receive presents.

22
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,290
Why?

23
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,830
I was born on December 24th.

24
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,100
Why did you have to be born on that day of all days?

25
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,280
Please complain about that to Dad and Mom.

26
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,630
All right! Let's go on a date.

27
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,110
A date?

28
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,220
If you're not going to take a present, then a date it is.

29
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,830
Happy?

30
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,030
Yes.

31
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,830
I'm happy.

32
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,420
I'm going to head up now.

33
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,200
Yes. I'll see you later.

34
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,510
No. We were talking about your future.

35
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,140
Tomoya-kun...

36
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,420
My future, eh?

37
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,220
Good morning, Okazaki!

38
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,000
And a toilet seat cover.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,750
You already did that one before.

40
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,140
You've got a really gloomy face so early in the morning.

41
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,680
Did you have a fight with Nagisa-chan?

42
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,490
Hey... Have you figured out what you want to do after here?

43
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,830
Of course.

44
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,080
To not worry my lovely sister, I've thought things through seriously and have come to a conclusion!

45
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,040
Seriously?

46
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,740
Yeah! I'm going to make money with my looks!

47
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,920
A model, I tell you. A model!

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,930
A model?

49
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,310
I think I'm fit for a model.

50
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,870
It's possible to shift into entertainment business through modeling, too, right?

51
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,550
Crap!

52
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,890
I might become famous.

53
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,430
I'll put lots of young ones under
my spell and form the Sunohara Legion.

54
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,920
You really are an optimist.

55
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,400
My future is blessed!

56
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,080
It works! Sunohara-kun,
you can become a model!

57
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,940
Really?! Yay!

58
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,200
You'll become a really popular model.

59
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,670
You will be able to go into the entertainment industry and form the Sunohara Legion, too.

60
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,080
All right.

61
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,380
Okazaki! I'll draft you into my legion one day, too!

62
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,980
I'll look forward to it.

63
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,410
Everyone other than me is a senior here, aren't they?

64
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,310
Do you all know what you'll be doing after you graduate?

65
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm planning on going to nursing school.

66
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,600
It's what I've wished to do for some time.

67
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,340
I'm aiming to become a kindergarten teacher.

68
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,550
So I'm going to a school that gives me the necessary degree.

69
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:52,160
I think... I'll be studying abroad in America.

70
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,230
It'll be sad to say goodbye to everyone,

71
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,950
but I'll come back to Japan as often as possible.

72
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,760
We won't be able to listen to your breathtaking violin anymore, huh?

73
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,040
If you crave for it, I can play it-

74
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,260
Stop!

75
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,970
Keep your thoughts to yourself.

76
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,800
You've got to learn to read into things a little more.

77
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm sorry. I'm working on it, but...

78
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,270
She's being very rude.

79
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,530
What will you be doing, Okazaki-kun?

80
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,790
I heard you haven't even decided whether to go to college or get a job,

81
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,970
even running away from teachers.

82
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,560
Come on, Nagisa. You've got to spank Tomoya's butt more.

83
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,440
Nagisa?

84
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,330
What's wrong, Nagisa?

85
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,880
I'm sorry... I feel a little...

86
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,380
Nagisa!

87
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,840
She's got a fever.

88
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,880
You don't have to be with Nagisa-chan?

89
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,550
A doctor's at home right now.

90
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,320
If I'm there, I'm sure I'd make things awkward.

91
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,360
Come in.

92
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,610
Sunohara. You've got a phone call from your sister.

93
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,960
Righty-o.

94
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,980
Anything you want to say to her?

95
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,540
Tell her to come visit again.

96
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,540
Oh, but don't tell her Nagisa's sick.

97
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,080
Okay.

98
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,250
What do you mean?

99
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,960
Furukawa-san's sick?

100
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,620
She's not very healthy to begin with.

101
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,530
She's repeating this year because she was short on her attendance last year for the same reason.

102
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,510
I see.

103
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,650
Make sure you do a good job taking care of her.

104
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,010
Nagisa.

105
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,580
Yes.

106
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,500
Don't bother. Stay down.

107
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,920
Okay, thank you.

108
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,790
I'll get going.

109
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,710
Yes. Have a good day.

110
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,210
Get a good rest, okay?

111
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,720
Yes.

112
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,600
Aren't you worrying too much?

113
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,100
Puhi! Puhi! Puhi! Puhi! Puhi! Puhi! Puhi!

114
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,500
It's happened before, too, hasn't it?

115
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,310
Last time Nagisa-chan got sick, you were so out of your mind.

116
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,570
I mean, at crucial times, you're...

117
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,660
Puhi-puhi-puhi. Puhi.

118
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,070
Puhi!

119
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,180
Puhi?

120
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,160
Puhi!

121
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,780
Did you come to see Kyou, again?

122
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,700
Tomoya!

123
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,280
Puhi.

124
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,870
Oh, you weren't trying to eat him?

125
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,680
Don't attack before finding out!

126
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,800
What should we do with her? Can you go home alone?

127
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,150
Puhi puhi.

128
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,760
Looks like she wants to be with you.

129
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,820
Impossible. I have PE this afternoon.

130
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,390
Can you babysit her?

131
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,630
Why me?

132
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,480
That's not right. Besides,
I'm her owner, too, so I'll-

133
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,240
Puhi!

134
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,650
Puhi puhi puhi!

135
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,850
She doesn't like you?

136
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,750
No...

137
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,050
I tried to put her in the bath some time ago,

138
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,460
but the water was too hot and it made her think I was planning on stewing her.

139
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,660
Puhi puhi puhi puhi!

140
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,330
Puhi!

141
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,080
Therefore, take care of her.

142
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,290
You're gonna make me sit through class with this on my lap?

143
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,290
Puhi puhi...

144
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,540
Botan, doll!

145
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,380
Pu!

146
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,850
It's one of Botan's seven tricks.

147
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,230
If you hold her like that,
people will think of you as a doll-maniac.

148
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,410
What are you doing?

149
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,600
You owe me bigtime for this.

150
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,560
I'll treat you to fruit milk tomorrow.

151
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,870
That's not enough.

152
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm so sorry about this.

153
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,490
We were thinking of paying a visit to Furukawa-san.

154
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,490
Oh, unfortunately, they said they were taking her to the hospital today.

155
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,120
I see. Then give her our best.

156
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah.

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,750
See you guys.

158
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,250
I hope it took his mind off things a little.

159
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,580
Puhi?

160
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,380
Puhi...

161
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,930
Tomoya-kun isn't happy.

162
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,600
He can be very sensitive at times.

163
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,400
I hope Nagisa-chan gets well soon.

164
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,590
A month went by.

165
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,740
Nagisa didn't get better.

166
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,750
One day, when she was feeling well, she forced her way to school.

167
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,950
But her fever went back up after only walking part-way to school.

168
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,800
How were exams?

169
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,540
So-so.

170
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,180
Thanks to attending more classes than before.

171
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,930
This is your test break.

172
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,500
Please don't worry about me and go play.

173
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,620
Let me stay here.

174
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,130
It'll be boring to stay here.

175
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,240
No, I'll wait here. That's enough fun for me.

176
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,630
Wait? Until what?

177
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,040
The day we can hold hands and walk.

178
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,000
We're together at home and school, but we didn't have much chance to be alone, right?

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,590
So I wanted to go on a date with you and hold hands.

180
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,550
We're alone right now.

181
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,180
Yeah.

182
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,500
Will you hold my hand?

183
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,370
November came.

184
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,750
With entrance exams coming, Seniors studied frantically.

185
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,990
In an environment like that,
the only thing on my mind was Nagisa.

186
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,950
Here are the tapes of theater you asked for.

187
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,470
I chose some that are fun and
give you energy just from watching.

188
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,020
Sorry for the trouble.

189
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,480
We owe you a big favor.

190
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,770
Thank you.

191
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,860
Okazaki-san, did you lose some weight?

192
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,950
It's your imagination.

193
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,830
Allow me to invite you to our, the cats' world, in return!

194
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,870
Wow, thank you!

195
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,960
The autumn went by like this.

196
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,060
The tension in the air started
to build, and winter drew near.

197
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,600
We figured you should know.

198
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,400
Okazaki-san. Nagisa might end up repeating her senior year again.

199
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,360
She can't take her exams,
and she'll be short on attendance, too.

200
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,920
The teachers said that she should withdraw from school and focus on getting better.

201
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,930
We are not worried about her educational record.

202
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,410
But Nagisa's...

203
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,270
We want to leave it to Nagisa to decide.

204
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,220
So even if she can't graduate, please accept that.

205
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,300
Please, Okazaki-san.

206
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,930
No.

207
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,310
I want to graduate with her.

208
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,640
I don't want to leave her behind there.

209
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,650
Okazaki-san...

210
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,540
If Nagisa isn't going to graduate, then I don't want to either.

211
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,450
What a child you are.

212
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,870
If you do something like that,
Nagisa will be hurt even more.

213
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,760
You understand that, don't you?

214
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,660
He was right.

215
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,080
I was a child.

216
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:29,270
I felt like I'd become a little better, being able to help some friends,

217
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,720
but the girl I love may not be able to graduate.

218
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:40,130
I was such a child that it was enough to put me at a loss.

219
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,140
When December came,
everything became busier.

220
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,210
Entrance exams.
College applications. Job searches.

221
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,320
I was left out of the groups.

222
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,040
Happy birthday!

223
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,710
Happy birthday, Nagisa-chan.

224
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,220
And, Merry Christmas!

225
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,510
You sure have energy for a rejected applicant.

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,290
He seriously sent an application to a modeling agency.

227
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,030
It was my right to!

228
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,700
I'll be looking for a job near
my home next year, so it's fine!

229
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,270
Nagisa.

230
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,310
Here's my present.

231
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,990
It's Dango!

232
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,610
Thank you very much.

233
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,420
Thank you very much, everyone.

234
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,600
Being here for someone like me...

235
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,670
Don't say things like, "someone like me", Nagisa.

236
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,860
You're part of our precious family.

237
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,110
He's right. And our precious friend.

238
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,080
If you become happy, then so will Sanae and I.

239
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,290
So seize your happiness, Nagisa.

240
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,300
Yes. I'll do my best.

241
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,720
That was the Christmas Eve.

242
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,130
Nagisa's birthday,

243
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,430
and also the day Nagisa's need to repeat became definite.

244
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,250
After the New Years,
fewer seniors came to school.

245
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,190
I was with Nagisa.

246
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,200
Small and fragile, but someone who continued to work hard.

247
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,490
I wanted to protect her forever.

249
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,650
Sunohara. Want to go around breaking some windows after this?

250
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,170
What's that?

251
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,930
I thought I might be able to repeat the year if I did that.

252
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,740
Rather than being forced to repeat, you'd probably get kicked out.

253
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,640
Oh, right.

254
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,270
Then that's pointless.

255
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,040
Oh, Okazaki and Sunohara.

256
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,550
Congratulations for graduating.

257
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,020
Thanks.

258
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,040
I'll be retiring after this year, too.

259
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,980
I'll be graduating with you guys, I guess.

260
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,850
Really?

261
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:45,490
I was hoping the Theater Club
would be solid with you around.

262
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,870
Don't worry about her.

263
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,500
She's much stronger and
more level-headed than you two.

264
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,500
You two are the ones who have to try hard.

265
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,810
I was lucky to meet students who needed a lot of my attention in the end.

266
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:07,520
If you hadn't set us straight, we probably would've been kicked out long ago.

267
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:15,720
I've been wondering for a while, but did you purposely have Sunohara and me meet?

268
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,320
What do you mean?

269
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,780
Sunohara and I are similar.

270
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,750
When either has a friend,
neither would quit school that easily.

271
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,790
Isn't that what you thought?

272
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,750
I don't remember.

273
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,740
After all, I'm pretty old.

274
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,970
You guys will be members of society starting tomorrow.

275
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,630
Be sure you attend
your last homeroom, all right?

276
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,250
Thank you for your guidance.

Thanks for a lot of stuff.

279
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,400
That's for us to say.

280
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,450
It's been decided that the sakura trees will remain.

281
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,110
This is all thanks to you.

282
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,710
Nagisa will be in your class next year.

283
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,620
Please look after her.

284
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,260
We know. Don't worry about it.

285
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,960
Best of luck to you, Okazaki-san.

286

Tomoya!

287
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,680
We're headed to a party after this,

288
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,670
but you've got somewhere to go, don't you?

289
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,710
Yeah.

290
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,720
Sweet bean bread!

291
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,850
...shouted out a complete lie without thinking!

292
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,760
You idiot! You shouldn't be outside!

293
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,170
I wanted to see you no matter what.

294
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,560
You in your uniform.

295
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,260
Tomoya-kun. Congratulations on graduating.

296
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,920
Nagisa...

297
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,670
I graduated...

298
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,830
Yes.

299
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,900
I won't ever be a student at that school again.

300
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,190
I hated school,

301
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,420
but if it was with you,

302
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,370
I wanted to spend all my time there forever.

303
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,550
My student life was rotten as hell,

304
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,980
but the last year I spent with you was fun.

305
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,010
I was happy!

306
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,070
I should have repeated, too, after all.

307
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,630
Tomoya-kun.

308
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,730
You can't stop like that.

309
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,840
If you can move on, then you should.

310
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,510
Please move on.

311
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,100
I'll do my best for another year.

312
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,560
Tomoya-kun.

313
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,380
Can we hold hands?

314
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,990
You idiot. Your fever's going to go up again.

315
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,170
Just for a little.

316
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,250
I want to walk holding hands with you.

317
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,590
I wanted to keep on walking without stopping...

318
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,590
...walking on and on...

319
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,600
...even the endless uphill climb...

320
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,240
...just the two of us...

321
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,470
What are your plans from here?

322
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,040
Nothing in particular.

323
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,910
Do you want to work for us for a while?

324
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,160
I look forward to working with you, Tomoya-san.

325
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,790
"Tomoya-san"?

326
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,880
Please let me call you by name.

327
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,870
