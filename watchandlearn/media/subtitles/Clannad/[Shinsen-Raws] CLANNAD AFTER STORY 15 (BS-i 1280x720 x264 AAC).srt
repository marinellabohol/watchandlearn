2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,100
Nagisa, can I have your autograph while I have the chance?

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,130
What doting parents.

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,650
Same thing will happen to you once you have a daughter, too.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,570
I swear it won't.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,840
I can see you having one,

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,730
since you are very much like Dad.

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,410
What? Me and him?!

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,770
Two months, eh?

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, it's been two months.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,500
You will have the baby, right?

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,170
Of course.

13
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,710
It's a piece of work, you know?

14
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,500
I'll protect her.

15
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,570
Tomoya-kun will be there for me, so I'll be all right.

16
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,690
We worked together until today.

17
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,720
He looks just like you on that day, Akio-san.

18
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:47,890
When I had Nagisa in my stomach, you said that you'd protect her.

19
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,190
I did, didn't I?

20
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,480
Good luck, you bum.

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,610
"Bum..."

22
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,120
But I'm not allowed to be one anymore.

23
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,160
Nagisa will probably have to take a break from work.

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,680
I'll have to support three people.

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,670
This is where the trial for my family begins.

26
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,590
A thought crossed my mind.

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,980
Did my old man think the same thing before I was born?

28
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,160
Congratulations.

29
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,000
What?

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,930
I heard you had a baby.

31
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,710
What?

32
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,650
Your wife had a kid?

33
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,160
Congratulations, Mr. Okazaki.

34
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,010
No, it's not born yet.

35
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,850
Yoshino-san, who did you hear it from?

36
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,620
My wife heard it from Sanae-san.

37
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,230
Everyone in the neighborhood knows about it.

38
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,730
To be feared: the power of neighbors.

39
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,130
You've still got a way to go as a member of society,

40
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,490
but now you'll have to act like
a real husband no matter what.

41
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,990
Yeah... but it doesn't feel real to me.

42
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,490
You'll feel that no matter what once the baby's born.

43
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,500
No one in this world can live alone.

44
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,500
Everyone lives by supporting and being supported by others.

45
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,270
There he goes...

46
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,350
It's been 4.5 billion years since
the Earth was formed in this vast universe...

47
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,640
The days started to move at an amazing speed.

48
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,010
By the time she entered the third month,

49
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,890
the pregnancy sickness became worse and Nagisa spent most days in bed.

50
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,870
I'm sorry for the trouble.

51
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,530
Don't worry; I can take care of these.

52
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,900
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,810
Don't apologize.

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,910
We're supposed to do this together, right?

55
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,840
Did you eat at all?

56
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,970
I couldn't eat much.

57
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,130
Isn't there any way to make this a little easier for you?

58
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,180
Apparently, it's not even known why pregnancy sickness even happens.

59
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,280
Drinking water only makes me sick, so I take these to get water.

60
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,410
It tastes good.

61
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you up?

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,200
How are you feeling?

63
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,180
I'm feeling all right now.

64
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,460
That's great.

65
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,250
You should eat some,
even a little, while you can.

66
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,710
What do you think?

67
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,500
Did you make these?

68
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,080
I'm not used to it, so the shape is a little... you know...

69
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,280
Thank you very much. I'll have some.

70
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,900
It's good!

71
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,470
While the days went flying away,

72
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,790
Nagisa and I were restless.

73
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,160
Good morning.

74
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,560
Is it all right for you to be up?

75
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,020
I feel very good today.

76
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,670
The doctor said that things will stabilize around the tenth week.

77
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,670
He was exactly right.

78
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,670
Must mean it's growing well.

79
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,340
Yes. I'm glad.

80
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,940
Um, I have something I wanted to talk about.

81
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,070
Give birth at home?

82
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes. I want to give birth to the baby here.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Can you even do such a thing?

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,560
I got this pamphlet for a maternity class yesterday at the hospital.

85
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,570
There's a page by a mother who gave birth at home.

86
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,580
So the father gives the first bath, eh?

87
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,370
At a hospital, there are cases where you can't hold the baby immediately.

88
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,930
I would like to be able to.

89
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,340
This is your and my house.

90
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,640
I want to give birth to the baby in our home. In this city.

91
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,500
What do you think?

92
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,940
Give birth at home?!

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,930
How was that drift?

94
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,440
How about you turn the game off?

95
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,500
You know, giving birth is hard enough, and  you're gonna try to pull it off at your home?

96
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,290
The doctor is worried about Nagisa's health,

97
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,010
but I want to fulfill Nagisa's wishes as much as possible.

98
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,400
That said, of course it's a question of how well she is at the time.

99
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,330
You're right. Having a safe delivery is the most important thing.

100
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,220
But when I gave birth to Nagisa, I was soon separated from her.

101
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,360
Akio-san held Nagisa after the doctors, too.

102
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,110
But I was the first one to lick you.

103
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,150
You licked me?!

104
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,520
You were that cute.

105
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,300
You can't do such a thing even if I was cute!

106
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,450
Too late now.

107
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,000
So you agree to giving birth at home?

108
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,170
If there's nothing to worry physically, then why not.

109
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,270
Make sure you give the first hug.

110
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,880
But...

111
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,010
I'll be the first to lick!

112
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,760
No. Tomoya-kun also gets the first lick!

113
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,380
No, I won't be licking.

114
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,280
Ah, right. He won't be.

115
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,020
What a stupid family.

116
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,610
This is Yagi-san.

117
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,950
She is my friend and works as a midwife.

118
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,990
I'm Yagi. Nice to meet you.

119
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,340
I'm Okazaki Nagisa.

120
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,110
Thank you for coming.

121
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,500
I'm her husband, Tomoya.

122
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,440
I was told you were looking into delivering the baby here.

123
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,320
Yes.

124
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,010
Can it be done in a place like this?

125
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,710
What's important is to be in a place where you can relax.

126
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,070
There's still time.

127
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,050
Please take the time to think things through.

128
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,560
We'll be in your care.

129
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,810
If anything happens,
please let me know any time.

130
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,880
Thank you very much.

131
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,440
Yagi-san knows that Nagisa has a weak body.

132
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,440
If those around worry about it too much,

133
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,950
the mother becomes uneasy, too,
so I was told to be mindful of that.

134
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,070
Okay.

135
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,020
What were you talking about with Mom?

136
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,640
Um... nothing in particular.

137
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,760
You don't need to hide it;
it was about my health, right?

138
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,390
I know how you, Mom, and Dad are all worried about it.

139
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,930
But, even if the worst happens to me,

140
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,890
I want to give birth to the baby.

141
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,570
Don't say such a thing.

142
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,900
We're all working so you have a safe delivery.

143
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,530
You're right. I'm sorry.

144
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,780
Doesn't this remind you of our high school days?

145
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,500
What?

146
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,670
Remember how we all worked together to make the stage a success?

147
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,250
I just thought that it's like that.

148
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,550
Can you tell? I'm your daddy.

149
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,640
You can't tell lies like that; the baby will believe you.

150
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,390
Your kid can't even take a joke?

151
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,760
It's Nagisa's baby, so it probably can't,

152
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,400
Gramps.

153
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,270
Don't call me that!

154
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,550
Apparently Akio-san wants to be called "Akki".

155
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,110
Hey, it's Akki. I'm Akki.

156
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,280
Quit the prenatal training.

157
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:44,420
The ears are there by this time, and it can hear the sounds from the outside,

158
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,040
so it's good to let it listen to music.

159
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,980
I'm always singing songs to it.

160
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:57,370
Dango, dango, dango, dango,

161
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,120
Big Dango Family.

162
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:08,020
Dango, dango, dango, dango,

163
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,080
Big Dango Family.

164
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,620
I thought everything was going well.

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,580
Or, perhaps somewhere in my heart,

166
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,610
I was eagerly anticipating that day coming.

167
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,460
I'm home.

168
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,160
Nagisa!

169
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,990
I'm all right.

170
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,230
I just got a little sick.

171
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,970
Nagisa called in the afternoon.

172
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,100
I rushed over, and Nagisa was on the floor.

173
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,680
Then you could have told me, too.

174
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,430
I'm sorry; I didn't want to disturb you at work.

175
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,810
Please don't worry. The baby's well.

176
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,860
I see.

177
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,680
Call me at any time anything happens.

178
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,190
To be on the safe side, I'll be with Nagisa during the day from tomorrow on.

179
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,940
That way you'll rest easy, right, Tomoya-san?

180
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,370
Yes. Thank you very much.

181
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,260
How are you feeling?
Is there anything you want?

182
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,220
I don't need anything.
I'm at ease when you're by my side.

183
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,010
Of course. Since you're strong, right?

184
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,980
Please don't worry, Tomoya-kun.

185
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,980
No, I wasn't...

186
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,030
I'm sure we can make it through if we're together, since I'm being protected by you.

187
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,830
Nagisa.

188
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,740
But...

189
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:49,010
I was no longer able to relax in the blessed feeling.

190
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,130
Tomoya-san.

191
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,640
Oh, Sanae-san.

192
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,530
Welcome home.

193
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,140
So this is where Nagisa was working.

194
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,000
I wanted to come here once, too.

195
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,820
It's a very trendy place.

196
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,600
No one uses that word nowadays.

197
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,340
Is that so?

198
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,530
I have something I need to tell you.

199
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,040
Yes?

200
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,040
It's about Nagisa.

201
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,790
I was told by the doctor that there will be some danger during the delivery.

202
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,080
I have not told this to Nagisa yet.

203
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,620
Only I've been told.

204
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,780
Exactly how much danger is there?

205
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,810
Don't say even Nagisa's life is at...

206
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,990
The stress to the mother will be greater than an average delivery's,

207
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,450
but there shouldn't be any problem with the delivery itself.

208
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,180
I see.

209
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,780
However that's if everything goes well.

210
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,960
As you know, Nagisa falls ill from time to time.

211
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,090
There are many mystery aspects to Nagisa's illness,

212
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,030
and the doctors are worried about the worst case scenario, as well.

213
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,580
This is something that needs to be thought through carefully.

214
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,770
That's why I wanted to tell you first.

215
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,330
You should tell Nagisa, and both of you should go listen to what the doctor has to say.

216
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,320
After that, let's all think together.

217
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,330
If we think of the worst case scenario,

218
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,300
should we give up on having the child?

219
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,440
I cannot answer that.

220
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,160
But, if that's the choice to make, then the sooner the better.

221
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,720
Please think it through carefully with Nagisa.

222
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,890
Sanae-san, as always, thank you.

223
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,350
We're a family, right?

224
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,890
I want to have the baby.

225
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,850
I knew you would say that.

226
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:23,320
I am a weak person, but I don't want to give up on the baby because of that.

227
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:29,120
If it's to have the baby, then I don't mind giving up on delivering here.

228
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,240
Nagisa...

229
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,000
I want to meet the baby.

230
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,000
What did the doctor say?

231
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,760
They said the risk would go down if she delivered at the hospital.

232
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,510
But I'm still worried.

233
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,800
Nagisa didn't change her mind, right?

234
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,740
No.

235
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,390
I think in her heart, she's scared, too.

236
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,020
She's acting cheerful, but I think she may be having the same feeling as me.

237
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,740
Come with me for a sec.

238
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:22,920
There!

239
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,170
This is my secret playground.

240
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,180
I play baseball with kids or sit and do nothing here a lot.

241
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:37,180
I noticed you went missing during work a lot, so this is where you were, huh?

242
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,970
The trees and bushes got torn down one after another...

243
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,070
There!

244
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,020
...and apparently a hospital's going to be built here soon.

245
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,920
Yay!

246
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,170
Sorry!

247
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,650
It's a great thing.

248
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,100
Thank you very much!

249
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,160
This is the continuation of something I told you two years ago.

250
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,070
It's when I was still in theater and Sanae was a teacher.

251
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,220
As I told you, Nagisa was always alone back then.

252
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:10,250
That day, Sanae and I left for work, leaving the sick Nagisa at home.

253
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,240
We both couldn't skip work.

254
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,950
Nagisa's condition looked stable, and both Sanae and I were planning to come home right away.

255
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,070
Nagisa was outside.

256
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,070
She was waiting until she collapsed.

257
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,570
By the time morning came,
it looked like there was no hope.

258
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,080
I never went through anything that sad.

259
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,310
This will be the first time I've told the story from this point on to anyone but Sanae.

260
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,360
Before I realized it, I was running with Nagisa in my arms.

261
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,720
I was running aimlessly, and I arrived here.

262
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,790
I prayed.

263
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,610
"Please save Nagisa."

264
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,770
"I don't want an ending like this."

265
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,820
All I could do was pray.

266
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,490
Right then, it felt like the plants here covered Nagisa.

267
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,590
I thought I was dreaming.

268
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,250
But it was reality.

269
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,680
Tears overwhelmed me, and I thanked everything in this world.

270
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,290
I've been looking after this place ever since.

271
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,720
I couldn't help but to think of this place as Nagisa's double.

272
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,560
Strange story, isn't it?

273
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,150
But it really happened.

274
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,780
Yeah. I believe you.

275
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,230
It's impossible for all wishes to come true if you pray for them.

276
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:57,490
But if you think and put your best effort forth until the end, then the outcome can't be that bad.

277
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,990
You're right.

278
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,600
I'm not telling you to have the baby.

279
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,390
I'm saying leave the judgment to the one who goes through the greatest pain,

280
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,500
and we'll just accept the result.

281
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,060
Hey, brat.

282
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,420
Or rather, Tomoya.

283
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,730
I'm sure there will be lots of hardships and painful stuff waiting for you ahead.

284
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,410
You guys can...

285
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,130
We can overcome them.

286
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,890
Yeah.

287
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,130
We're a family.

288
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,400
We're going to help each other.

289
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,160
The wind feels nice and cold.

290
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,780
It just moved!

291
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,840
Really?

292
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,920
Yes.

293
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,060
It felt like I was rubbed from the inside.

294
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,240
Really?

295
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,900
How about we come up with a name?

296
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,900
Yeah. We'll need one if it's a boy and another if it's a girl.

297
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,440
How about we use one character from your name?

298
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,380
No, rather than that, let's think of something out of your name.

299
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,850
I can pass on the last name.

300
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,400
But it's difficult to use my name.

301
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,500
It'd become like Nagisako or Nagisami.

302
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,960
You don't have to use it literally.

303
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,370
Something that traces back to Nagisa should do.

304
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
I see...

305
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,120
In that case...

306
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,770
How does Ushio sound?

307
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,770
Ushio?

308
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:53,770
Yes. It's about how the water tide rises and goes out.

309
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,890
If it's this, it can be used for a boy or a girl.

310
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,160
Okazaki Ushio, eh?

311
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,310
I'm sure a lot will happen within a life.

312
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:15,470
But as time passes, things will return to you.

313
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,430
That will continue, and I will watch over Ushio.

314
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,570
Rather than a "nagisa", a bay, "ushio" is more grand, isn't it?

315
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,400
You're right.

316
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,180
Since it's the ocean.

317
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:36,000
Will it be able to grow up to be someone with the kindness to embrace and nurture anything?

318
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,190
I hope it will.

319
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,780
We couldn't go to the beach again this summer.

320
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,000
You're right.

321
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,700
I wanted to see the ocean with you, too.

322
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,960
Then let's make a promise.

323
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,990
What?

324
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,460
Next year, we'll go to the beach with Ushio.

325
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,710

326
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,160
A promise...

327
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,220
You will promise to, won't you, Nagisa?

328
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,100
Yes, I promise.

329
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,830
There may be more than one hidden world.

330
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,540
There's a theory of multiple worlds existing, too.

333
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:11,350
Yes. There is no one future,
but there are many possibilities.

334
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,970
I still think that.
