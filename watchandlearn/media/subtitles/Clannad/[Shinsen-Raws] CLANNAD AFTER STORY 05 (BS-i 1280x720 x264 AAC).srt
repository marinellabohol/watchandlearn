00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,170
What are these lights?

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,340
What could these lights that shine brightly at times be?

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,700
It seems like you can touch them, and yet cannot.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,640
So could these lights be shadows of something?

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,590
If they are shadows,
their bodies must exist somewhere else.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,360
Could things that exist somewhere else
in some other world be creating these lights?

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,980
It's done.

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,510
Let's give it a try.

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,730
There you go.

11
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,000
See, this is how you play with this.

12
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,550
It's fun, isn't it?

13
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,840
Toys are meant to be played by two people.

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,880
Before I came here, she couldn't do this even if she wanted to.

15
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,460
I wonder what she always did when she was alone...

16
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,740
...when she was alone in this sad world...

17
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,890
If only I could shed tears.

18
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,270
I guess winter exists even in a world like this.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,420
Does this sky lead to another world?

20
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:02,680
Would that world, perhaps, be where I came from? The warm and lively world?

21
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,650
It's Misae-san's kitty.

22
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,480
What's wrong?

23
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,860
Isn't your master getting better with her moves?

24
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,660
You'll never do something like that again, will you?!

25
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,180
I won't... I swear...

26
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,490
Oh.

27
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,080
If it isn't Furukawa-san and her boyfriend.

28
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,330
You were here?

29
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,410
Good evening, Misae-san.

30
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,870
Be nicer to me.

31
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,630
You're overreacting; it's just a little bruise.

32
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,040
Um, we brought some leftover dishes for Sunohara-san.

33
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,080
Mom packed them thinking you were lonely with Mei-chan gone.

34
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,300
Seriously? Thank you!

35
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,340
I told you. No one gets lonely in this dorm.

36
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,960
You're right. It's too lively if you ask me.

37
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,430
I'll bring some tea out, so sit tight.

38
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,200
My appreciation for protecting him.

39
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,030
Protecting?

40
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,170
That jerk tried to sell the cat off.

41
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,260
I thought I could make a quick buck
if I took it to a pet shop.

42
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,970
Of course not.

43
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,780
What's the name of this kitty?

44
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,700
Nanashi.

45
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,640
Nanashi-chan, is it?

46
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,700
Can I call you Nana-chan?

47
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,130
No, not Nanashi-chan. I just haven't named him.

48
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,290
Note: Nanashi means "Nameless"

49
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,290
And that's a boy.

50
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,330
He's nameless?

51
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,460
But isn't he your cat?

52
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:28,920
I never wanted it, but starting some time ago, it began to stay around me,

53
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,740
so I'm just taking care of it because of how things turned out.

54
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,260
Then what's the big deal if I sell him?

55
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,140
Or maybe stew him up?

56
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,290
Stew what up?

57
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,140
Joking! Just joking.

58
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,930
He's been attached to you for a while, hasn't he?

59
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,780
Why?

60
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,680
Do your clothes smell like catnip?

61
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,700
No way.

62
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,750
Come in.

63
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,600
Excuse me.

64
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,660
What is everyone doing here?

65
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,070
This is rare. Tomoyo, what are you doing here?

66
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,170
It's not that rare.

67
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,290
Sakagami-san comes to visit often.

68
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,030
I come to get advice as the Student Council President.

69
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,870
This is a perfect opportunity since this involves both Okazaki and Sunohara.

70
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,930
Eliminate all tardiness and absence from school?

71
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,860
Yes.

72
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,370
Misae-san was the first female Student Council President in our school's history.

73
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,360
And she accomplished the legendary Week of No Tardiness and Absence.

74
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,690
That sure brings back memories.

75
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,000
I want to know how you united the entire school.

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,410
I want to make it happen, too.

77
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:41,330
It'd be really difficult, since there are two who are the biggest obstacles.

78
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,040
Who could she be talking about?

79
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,030
Don't know.

80
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,590
Tomoya-kun's up early and going to school on time with me now.

81
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,480
Then that leaves Sunohara as the problem.

82
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,560
Should I come to your room to wake you again?

83
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,600
I wish you wouldn't.

84
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,130
How did you do it?

85
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,550
I really didn't do anything special.

86
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,300
I simply said at the morning assembly to try not to be late or absent for a week.

87
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,260
Then everyone went along with it for fun.

88
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,780
That's all you did?

89
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,510
If I could say one thing,
I guess not trying too hard only helped.

90
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,620
I don't really understand.

91
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,650
If you get all worked up yourself,
you'll always get someone who'll rebel.

92
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,830
Being too eager brings negative results.

93
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,080
I see. That's a great point.

94
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,780
I'm getting quite a few guests today.

95
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,880
Come on in.

96
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,240
Good evening.

97
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,580
Don't worry about them.

98
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,780
Do you need something?

99
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,270
Um, about what I asked the other day...

100
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,810
Ah, that.

101
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,820
Sign: Hikarizaka Shrine Autumn Festival - 9/23 10pm

102
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,490
Here.

103
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,080
An Autumn Fest?

104
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,030
Tomorrow?

105
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,400
It's a festival that's been around for a while that wishes for peace and happiness.

106
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,740
I think it's a good choice for your first date.

107
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,400
I-I see!

108
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,700
You're amazing, Misae-san!

109
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,660
You're a lifesaver.

110
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,370
He was asking for advice for where to go on his date.

111
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,420
Stop it already. You shouldn't be eavesdropping like that.

112
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,470
She's right. Everyone needs privacy.

113
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,170
Don't be such killjoys.

114
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,990
Thank you very much.

115
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,420
You're very welcome.

116
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,350
What were you doing?

117
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,270
Sunohara-san was eavesdropping on the date plans.

118
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,860
Divine retribution!

119
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,610
Misae-san, you're being relied on by many students.

120
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,780
How admirable. I would like to become like you.

121
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,830
I've been that kind of person for a long time now.

122
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,040
Seriously.

123
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,320
It means you're charismatic.

124
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,290
There are a lot of guys who are fans of yours in my class, too.

125
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,900
It's great that I'm liked,

126
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,710
but I don't know what they see in a woman who only yells.

127
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,810
You don't just yell. You worry about others, which is the good part.

128
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:07,130
And, this is something someone on the rugby club said, you have a good smell of soap.

129
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,870
In this dirty boy's dorm,
you've become an idol-like figure.

130
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,940
Like a jewel in a dunghill.

131
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,080
Yell... and worry...

132
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,330
And a good smell.

133
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,030
What's wrong?

134
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,010
It's nothing.

135
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,790
It's just that someone said a similar thing to me in the past.

136
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,570
I was just remembering that.

137
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,030
Thank you for your advice.

138
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,010
Sorry I bothered you at night.

139
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,820
It's fine. Come anytime you like.

140
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,240
I will see you again.

141
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,950
Sunohara, you go back to your room, too.

142
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,010
Why?

143
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,060
There's still time before lights-out.

144
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,980
I've got something to talk about with these two.

145
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,770
You're unwanted.

146
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,780
Can you be more direct than that?

147
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,700
Sign: Hikarizaka Shrine Autumn Festival - 9/23 10pm

148
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,920
Go to this?

149
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,440
Yup. Sunohara was saying that you rarely take Furukawa-san out on dates.

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,210
That's our problem!

151
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,330
If you're saying something like that, some other guy will snatch Furukawa-san away.

152
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,220
Th-That won't happen!

153
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,770
I won't be snatched away by anyone else.

154
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,240
Look. You won't find another girl who would say something like that to you.

155
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,840
Why are you bringing up something like this now?

156
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,610
Looking at you two reminded me of my wonderful youthful days.

157
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,720
You're still young, Misae-san.

158
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,650
Thank you.

159
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,550
But I'm all right.

160
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,870
Right now, my role is to take care of you younglings.

161
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,210
All right.

162
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,220
Hang around a bit more, will you?

163
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,840
I'll make another pot of tea.

164
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,140
What was this school like when you were the president?

165
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,950
Nothing special.

166
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,060
It was an ordinary school.

167
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,100
I'm sure you had lots of friends.

168
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,470
Yeah. It was lively every day, keeping me entertained.

169
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,690
Getting hurt... Getting worried...

170
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,180
But I'm still...

171
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,450
Listen well.

172
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,070
This charm has a light in it.

173
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,080
It's a light that grants any one wish.

174
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,000
You will take this and go to her.

175
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,040
And you will grant her wish.

176
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,000
Do you understand?

177
00:11:48,020 --> 00:12:01,110
Sign: Hikarizaka Private High School

178
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,130
Igarashi-kun! Are you on
your way home now, too?

179
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,920
Yeah. You too, Sagara?

180
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,900
Yeah, what a coincidence.

181
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,230
You know, if you don't mind-

182
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,270
Who's he?

183
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,850
Looks like he's from a different school.

184
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,760
Is he your boyfriend?

185
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,920
I guess I shouldn't get between you two.

186
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
See you tomorrow.

187
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,700
Ah, wait!

188
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,050
Um, you're Sagara Misae-san, right?

189
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,780
Who are you?

190
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,230
I'm Shima Katsuki.

191
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,360
Don't I look familiar?

192
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,700
Wait.

193
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,190
I will not.

194
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,870
I don't know you, nor do I see a reason for you to pay me back at all.

195
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,640
Maybe you don't, but I do.

196
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,710
Maybe you do, but I don't!

197
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,740
Besides, because of you, he misunderstood!

198
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,480
I've had enough. I'm going home!

199
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,810
W-Wait!

200
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,040
Tell me your wish!

201
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,350
Wish?

202
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,450
I came to grant your wish.

203
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,860
So I can't go home until then.

204
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,070
Then stop standing in front of me right this moment.

205
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,360
Got a problem with that?

206
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,980
If... If that really is what you wish for, then I will.

207
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,770
But that won't really satisfy me.

208
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,750
Since you took such good care of me.

209
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,760
It was back when I was in elementary school.

210
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,640
I think you were going to the hospital to visit your mother.

211
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,830
When you went, you cheered me up when you found me in the hospital's courtyard.

212
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,910
You don't remember this?

213
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,370
I was in a wheelchair with a cat on my lap.

214
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,210
I remember now.

215
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:04,900
You do?!

216
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,650
But I didn't do anything.

217
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,590
We only spoke for a bit.

218
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,100
That's not true.

219
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,290
You really cheered me up.

220
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,720
What exactly did I say?

221
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,770
Ah...

222
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,250
I forgot.

223
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,760
But I really am grateful to you.

224
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,670
That's why I want to return the favor.

225
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,260
Then treat me to a can of juice.

226
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,730
That's more than enough.

227
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,600
Since I really didn't do anything so meaningful.

228
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,420
Listen. I can grant any wish.

229
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,620
I have something that allows that to happen.

230
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,690
So don't hesitate and say something you really wish for.

231
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,970
What is that? Something like a genie's lamp?

232
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,980
Not a lamp, but that's what I was told.

233
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,760
By who?

234
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,060
Ah...

235
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,900
I don't know.

236
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,590
You're a real strange one.

237
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,850
You think so?

238
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,500
And a romantic, too.

239
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,270
I'm sorry, but I don't believe in those things.

240
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,340
H-Hey!

241
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,650
Thank you for coming all the way to say thanks.

242
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,980
It's great to see that you've recovered.

243
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,310
Bye. Take care.

244
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,560
Good morning!

245
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,220
Misae, who is he?

246
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,710
He's so cute.

247
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,840
Did you switch from Igarashi-kun to him?

248
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,310
Do...

249
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,700
Don't wait in front of the school gate!

250
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,320
You're... You're hurting me!

251
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,520
You made Saki and Yuki misunderstand!

252
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,280
What are you going to do if a rumor starts?

253
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,030
Misunderstand what?

254
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,420
Look. You're a boy and I'm a girl.

255
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,630
Don't you have any imagination?

256
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,240
Ah, I got it. You like Igarashi-kun, right?

257
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,190
Aren't you really direct?

258
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,770
You're really beautiful, so I'm sure it'll work out.

259
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,140
Oh yeah! Let's ask him out!

260
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,660
I'll come with you.

261
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,280
Why...

262
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,940
Why must I ask him out with you?!

263
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,620
Th-That hurt...

264
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,000
Hey! You came to grant my wish, didn't you?!

265
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,780
So why are you getting in my way?!

266
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,570
Then can the wish be to get married to Igarashi-kun?

267
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,870
Is that all right?

268
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
You can't.

269
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,260
Why not?

270
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,080
You can't manipulate other people's feelings.

271
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,550
Welcome back.

272
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,910
You didn't have to do that all of a sudden.

273
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,050
I told you not to wait at the gate.

274
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,380
You're really being bothered by him, aren't you?

275
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,890
Shima-kun, was it?

276
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,590
You see, Misae has someone she likes.

277
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,160
If Igarashi-kun sees this...

278
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,120
Did you call me?

279
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,710
Hey, it's Sagara's boyfriend.

280
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,420
Introduce me, will ya?

281
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,200
N-No! He isn't! He's nothing like that!

282
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,580
I hope he really got it.

283
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,080
It's fine. I'm sure Igarashi-kun will come to like you, too.

284
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,210
You're really strange.

285
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,210
What?

286
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,840
You don't get jealous or annoyed even if I like another boy?

287
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,410
No...

288
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,100
I think I'm just slow at those kinds of things.

289
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,730
I don't dislike those kinds of things about you.

290
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,650
It's nice how pure you are.

291
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,210
Do you want to catch a cold?

292
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,810
Why don't you at least have an umbrella with you?

293
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,420
I didn't think it would start raining.

294
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,830
Why am I taking care of someone like you?

295
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,770
I'm sorry.

296
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,020
If you're going to apologize,
then don't make me take care of you.

297
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,340
Here. I borrowed a jersey for you, so change into these.

298
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:11,820
Okay.

299
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,160
Seriously...

300
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,160
If you can grant anything,
couldn't you have stopped the rain?

301
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,840
I can't do that!

302
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,620
I can only grant one wish, and it's for you.

303
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,090
I don't understand why you're so grateful to me.

304
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,420
You don't even remember what I said to you.

305
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,100
It's probably the fact that you talked to me more than what you said to me.

306
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,200
Since you're very optimistic.

307
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,640
I hear that often.

308
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,930
I think I was able to try because I met someone like you.

309
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,600
So it is all thanks to you.

310
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,100
It's time for class, so I've got to go now.

311
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,410
Sneak out later.

312
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:57,990
Okay.

313
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,580
Hey, it's Sagara's boyfriend.

314
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,000
Waiting for her again?

315
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,610
Um, I'm not Sagara-san's boyfriend.

316
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,670
You aren't?

317
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,590
No. Apparently she already has someone she likes.

318
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,350
Hey, can you do me a favor?

319
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,180
What's wrong? You look so gloomy.

320
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,430
Did you really catch a cold?

321
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,560
Then what's wrong?

322
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,610
Is something troubling you?

323
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,390
I know how Sagara feels about me.

324
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,350
But I already have a girlfriend as you see.

325
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,620
So can you drop a hint to her about this?

326
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,960
You're too nice to everyone, Igarashi-kun.

327
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,140
What can I do? It's how I am.

328
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,010
So please. While hurting her as little as possible.

329
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,540
Hey, what happened?

330
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,390
Talk to your big sis.

331
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,020
Could you possibly be in love?

332
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,480
Maybe.

333
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,140
Seriously?

334
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,830
I pulled that one out of thin air.

335
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,710
Then why do you look so depressed?

336
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,330
That's because I have sad news for her.

337
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,830
What do you mean?

338
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,690
She has another boy she likes...

339
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,090
...but that other boy already has a girlfriend.

340
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,050
I was asked by him to pass that on to her.

341
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,330
Sounds like a drama.

342
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,720
But that's a chance for you!

343
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,330
If you comfort her when she's depressed from the shock of a broken heart,

344
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,030
she might come to like you.

345
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,280
Come on, Shima-kun.

346
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,610
Stop being depressed and think positively.

347
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,690
Yeah?

348
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,140
This is a great chance for you.

349
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,740
I can't possibly think like that!

350
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,320
If you were in my shoes...

351
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,340
...could you do that?

352
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,360
Could you think like that?

353
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,760
When you like that person so much!

354
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,220
Could you think of it as an opportunity when the person is broken-hearted?

355
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,700
Sorry. I'm sorry.

356
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,670
Girls around me all think positively like that, so...

357
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,170
Shima-kun... What you said just now...

358
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,750
I see...

359
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,830
I'm such an idiot.

360
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,960
Why are you the one crying?

361
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,530
I don't know.

362
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:59,100
That was the name of the person dearest to me.

363
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:11,010
We spent much time together,
and she left me with her last wish.

364
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,710
I came to grant that wish.
