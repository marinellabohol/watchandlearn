2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,650
We're back.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,030
Welcome back.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,730
Was the trip fun?

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,520
Yup.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,360
Sanae-san. Please go on
a date with me next time.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:30,380
The place changes and goes. Like a wind, like clouds,

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,040
What?

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,950
Well, you broke your promise.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,420
I was so looking forward to going on a trip with you.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,050
Hey! Stop hitting on someone else's wife.

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,670
Akki!

13
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:44,060
Like the traces of the heart, no halt at the places.

14
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,510
Ushio, of course you'll be coming with us on the date.

15
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,170
Right?

16
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:35,840
Yup.

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,660
Then let me come, too.

18
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,270
Let's have a good time with the three of us, Tomoya-san, Ushio.

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,550
Don't leave me out!

20
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:55,240
The place is so far away be far apart.

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:08,500
People's hand does not reach, so merely has the worship.

22
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:20,970
The place is a lofty lord, can't meet nobody put on.

23
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,940
Nagisa...

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,210
Tomoya-san.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,970
It hasn't changed, has it?

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,700
I've left it just the way it was on the day she married you.

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:34,030
We will lose the place, so lofty which changes.

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,920
No, it hasn't changed at all.

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,780
Would you like to take that with you?

30
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,150
Those dolls.

31
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,790
Ushio loves them, too.

32
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:45,870
Not all were desired. However, we're never sad.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,990
I'm sorry for all these years.

34
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,910
What?

35
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,370
I forced Ushio on you for all these years.

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,470
It's thanks to you I was able to realize that I'm a father.

37
00:01:46,290 --> 00:02:00,300
Still, there is still the place. Far away. Far away.

38
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,420
I haven't done anything.

39
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,280
She's a really good girl.

40
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,340
I don't know how to thank you.

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,900
All right, next up is the imitation of Mikawa!

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,450
Mikawa!

43
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,210
But starting today, I will raise her myself.

44
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,630
I will raise her to be a strong and caring person like Nagisa.

45
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,490
When we changed our occupations for Nagisa, she was also five years old.

46
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,700
Good luck.

47
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,460
I will spend the rest of my life to repay your gratitude.

48
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,040
Then please have a wonderful life.

49
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:40,220
The place buried in deep snow. Like the collapsing castle.

50
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,210
I will!

51
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,840
Together with Ushio.

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,700
Okay.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,170
Daddy!

54
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:53,440
Like the head of the shade, figure will be thrown away.

55
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,350
What's up, Ushio?

56
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,770
Akki said let's play baseball.

57
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,860
Huh?

58
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,260
Go!

59
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,400
Good luck.

60
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,400
A guy that used to have eyes of a dead fish is up and about.

61
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:05,700
The hut buried in deep snow. It sinks in to the flood.

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,070
Shut up and throw it already!

63
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,910
Ushio! Observe your father's pathetic look!

64
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,700
Hey, hey, hey!

65
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,270
Who do you think will win, Ushio?

66
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:18,760
And the 'not dyeing' is dyed out, and waits for a oppose one.

67
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,250
Akki.

68
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,410
Seriously?!

69
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,130
She grew up seeing my great arm.

70
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,250
Then I'll just hit it!

71
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,030
Bull crap.

72
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:30,930
The place is a lofty lord. Can't meet nobody put on.

73
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,060
No way!

74
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,590
See that, Ushio?

75
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,220
Ya!

76
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:46,870
Still, there is still the place. Far away. Far away.

77
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,690
Looks like we have to go apologize again.

78
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,700
Sanae, you're not one to talk about others.

79
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,740
You haven't cried since that day.

80
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,330
I'm surprised you noticed.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,670
Of course. Who do you think I am?

82
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,090
Well, I had something to do.

83
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,630
I had to raise Ushio.

84
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,640
So it was good; I didn't have the chance to lose myself.

85
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,560
Five years, eh?

86
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,430
We were saved by Ushio a lot.

87
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,980
Yes, really.

88
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,110
But even that has come to an end.

89
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,610
Yes.

90
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,950
Good work for many years.

91
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,740
It was nothing; we're a family.

92
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,290
It's all right, you know?

93
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,710
You've done well.

94
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,960
Now it's your turn to cry.

95
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,050
Akio-san...

96
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,050
Even with all hope gone, I'll still help you.

97
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,300
I'll be here until you stop crying.

98
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,720
So it's all right now.

99
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,340
We'll be going now.

100
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,340
Bye-bye.

101
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,760
Off you go.

102
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,670
Yeah, go and score!

103
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,300
Ya!

104
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,890
You understand what he means?

105
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,390
You'll get to live with your father starting today.

106
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,970
Be sure to be a good girl.

107
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,890
Yup.

108
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,560
On days I'm busy with work, can I still ask you to take her to or pick her up from kindergarten?

109
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,270
Sure, leave it to me.

110
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,360
Tomoya-san, how about your...

111
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,280
I know.

112
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,990
I intend to visit him soon.

113
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,290
I heard the particulars from Furukawa-san.

114
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,380
It's nice meeting you.

115
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,630
Same here. Nice to meet you.

116
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,510
All right then, Ushio.
Daddy's off to work, all right?

117
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,800
Yup. Have a good day, Daddy.

118
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,260
Yeah. See you.

119
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,060
Look. That's Okazaki-san.

120
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,940
I wonder what he was doing all this time?

121
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,280
Did something happen with the Furukawas?

122
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,450
Family dispute, perhaps?

123
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,070
I bet I would have snapped if this had happened a few years ago.

124
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,780
Hi, I'm Okazaki.

125
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,990
I'm Okazaki Ushio's father.

126
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,660
Hello.

127
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,500
I've been leaving her at my wife's home due to circumstances beyond my control,

128
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,050
but we'll be living together starting today.

129
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,470
I hope we'll get along.

130
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,300
Oh, same here.

131
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,260
My child's a good friend of Ushio-chan.

132
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,180
I hope we'll get along.

133
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,230
Really? So you'll be living with her from now on?

134
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,810
Yes. Sorry for worrying you for all these years.

135
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,400
But won't it be hard to raise a small child alone?

136
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,410
Sanae-san and the old man took care of the most critical days.

137
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,330
No matter what I may face, it won't be
anything compared to what those two faced.

138
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,250
Come to me if you ever need anything.

139
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,380
The company will try to accommodate you as much as possible.

140
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,960
Oh, in that case, something right off the bat.

141
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,510
Daddy!

142
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,640
I'm here to get you, Ushio.

143
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,220
Hi.

144
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,350
Right now, it's the summer session, so Ushio-chan's teacher's on holiday.

145
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,770
Holiday? Sick perhaps?

146
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,320
She's off to a child-care seminar.

147
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,530
She'll be back next week, so you will meet her when she returns.

148
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,610
Okay.

149
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,080
What's your teacher like?

150
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,500
Long hair, beautiful, and kind.

151
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,660
Really?

152
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,130
All right, Daddy's going to go back to work now.

153
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,960
Even if a stranger comes,
don't open the door, okay?

154
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,630
Okay.

155
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,090
If anything happens, call Sanae-san.

156
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,180
You know how to make calls, right?

157
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,550
I do.

158
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,390
I'll be back before dark.

159
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,020
Okay.

160
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,730
I'm off.

161
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,940
Bye-bye,

162
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,810
Daddy.

163
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,920
Yes!

164
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,630
It's Daddy. My hands are full with stuff; open the door for me.

165
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,310
I brought them from the Furukawas.

166
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,060
The Big Dango Family, your toys,
and changes of clothes.

167
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,900
Let's put this somewhere first.

168
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,570
Where do you think is best?

169
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Here.

170
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,120
All right. There it'll be.

171
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,960
Can you cook, Daddy?

172
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,510
I'll learn little by little.

173
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,260
We'll learn together.

174
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:40,880
Yup!

175
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,550
Okazaki-san!

176
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,760
Kouko-san.

177
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,770
Long time no see.

178
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,600
I wonder how many years it has been.

179
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,520
So she's...

180
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,270
My daughter, Ushio.

181
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,400
Ushio, say hi.

182
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,110
Hello.

183
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,860
Yes, hello.

184
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,410
I'm Yoshino Kouko.

185
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,950
So she's Nagisa-chan's...

186
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,700
She does resemble her.

187
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,630
I'm sure she'll grow up to be a strong and cute girl like Nagisa-chan.

188
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,210
I hope so, too.

189
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,670
She used to be Mommy's teacher.

190
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,090
Oh, right. Yoshino-san told me.

191
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,510
I heard your sister got discharged.

192
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,850
Congratulations.

193
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:36,400
Yes. The doctors said it's a miracle,
but we always believed she'd be back.

194
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,070
I'm actually with her today.

195
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,450
Fu-chan!

196
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,370
Say hi.

197
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,830
They're my friends.

198
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,420
This is your sister?

199
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,890
What an interesting sister.

200
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,310
Don't worry, Fu-chan; he's my friend.

201
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,690
This is my younger sister, Fuko.

202
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,900
This is Okazaki-san and Ushio-chan.

203
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,610
Nice to meet you.

204
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,360
Yeah, nice to meet you.

205
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,650
Nice to meet you.

206
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,450
What?

207
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,540
She's cute! Can I give her a hug?!

208
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,670
You didn't even wait for an answer!

209
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,130
Stop it, Fu-chan. You're being rude.

210
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,300
I'm sorry. She's like that.

211
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,300
How old is she?

212
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,510
The same age as you.

213
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:55,180
But since she's been sleeping all these years, she still feels like she's a freshman.

214
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,770
Why does she look no different from Ushio?

215
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,020
You're both very rude.

216
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,490
Fuko's mad, so Fuko's going to make her Fuko's sister.

217
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,450
Stop saying nonsense.

218
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,780
It's not going to fly?

219
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,530
No!

220
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,410
What a shame.

221
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,130
She was a little strange, but it was nice that you made a new friend.

222
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,050
Yup.

223
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:30,180
Ushio, I don't have to go to work tomorrow. Will you come with me?

224
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,850
Another trip?

225
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,810
Not a trip.

226
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,360
You like the Big Dango Family, too?

227
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,570
Sanae-san said this is how Mommy smelled.

228
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,690
I see.

229
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,780
Smells good.

230
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:22,940
Note: The radio is broadcasting the results of a horserace.

231
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,630
I'm home.

232
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,780
Ah, Tomoya-kun.

233
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,290
I'm home.

234
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,790
Yeah.

235
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,880
You've gotten old, Pops.

236
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,300
Yeah.

237
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,800
She's your granddaughter.

238
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,220
Hello.

239
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,430
Hello.

240
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,560
Have you been here all this time?

241
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,650
Yeah.

242
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,610
I met your mother.

243
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,320
I went on a trip with her.

244
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,910
Way up north.

245
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,950
The place you took me once before.

246
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,290
I heard a lot of stories.

247
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,210
It made me think that you must have been through many troubles.

248
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,010
I remembered a lot of things from the past, too.

249
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,220
Hey, Pops.

250
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,220
You must be tired.

251
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,930
I think it's all right for you to rest now.

252
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,980
How about going home?

253
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,270
Your mother's waiting.

254
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,780
Right where you took my hand and promised to raise me with your own hands.

255
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,290
You've done enough.

256
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,120
So relax now.

257
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,580
Go home and live with
your mother for her, too.

258
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,460
Yeah?

259
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,310
Is it... over now?

260
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,570
What is?

261
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,530
Have I done it?

262
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,750
You sacrificed everything and raised me.

263
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:59,840
You spent your entire life on a worthless son like me.

264
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,680
You've done enough.

265
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,180
I see...

266
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,520
So I managed to do it without even knowing.

267
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,610
How great.

268
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,200
It's great.

269
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,520
I'll put a change of clothes and some money in, all right?

270
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Yeah. Thank you.

271
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,230
I'll give her a call.

272
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,150
Don't lose your bags on the way, all right?

273
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,400
Yeah. I'll be careful.

274
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,660
I'll handle the house.

275
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,030
I'll take care of the debts, too.

276
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,540
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,170
Ushio, say bye-bye to your granddad.

278
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,420
Bye-bye, Granddad.

279
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,130
Yeah.

280
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,760
I'll be going now.

281
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,260
Take care of yourself.

282
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,220
Yeah.

283
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,390
Don't drink too much.

284
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,690
Yeah.

285
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,270
Tomoya!

286
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,440
There, have a snack.

287
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,780
Don't smoke too much, too.

288
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,030
Yeah.

289
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,660
Dad's got to go again,
but don't eat too much, all right?

290
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,580
Live long.

291
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,250
Sorry I have to leave you alone all the time.

292
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll definitely go to return the gratitude.

293
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,460
I'll make our dinner when I come back, all right?

294
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,340
I will go, all right?

295
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,420
We'll eat it together, okay?

296
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,300
All right, Tomoya?

297
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,440
What's wrong, Tomoya?

298
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,530
Why are you crying?

299
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,120
Sorry, Ushio.

300
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,170
You don't have to worry.

301
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,380
Father.

302
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Thank you for all these years.

303
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,380
Yeah.

304
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,480
I'll go now.

305
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,980
Yeah. Take care.

306
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,150
You, too, Tomoya.

307
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,950
I wonder if he had a good life or not.

308
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:17,920
He lost his dearest person at the happiest time in his life, and he's been alone with me ever since.

309
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,920
He kept working for an ungrateful son like me.

310
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,590
I wonder if he had a good life like that or not.

311
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,770
Father...

312
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,210
What is it, Ushio?

313
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,960
Light...

314
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,170
Oh, is it bright there?

315
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,420
Come here.

316
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,990
Oh yeah, Ushio. You're going to have a visitor tomorrow.

317
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,290
Do you know any games, Ushio?

318
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,830
Ushio, say "I'm going" to Mommy.

319
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,670
Hey, Ushio!

320
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,580
It's dangerous, so wait!

321
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,550
Daddy.

322
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,340
Good luck.
