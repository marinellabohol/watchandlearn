2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,560
Two lights shimmered.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,900
In this world where cold winds blow, they shimmered brightly and warmly for just an instant.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,950
Something was starting to change...

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,740
...along with the approaching winter.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,040
As the temperature dropped, she slept more often.

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,050
Those clouds that appeared several days ago are slowly spreading out.

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,100
The clouds will eventually cover the world and the snow will settle on the ground.

9
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,190
It'll be too late if we don't hurry.

10
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,860
I knew the time to decide was now.

11
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,910
You stayed by me all this time?

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,540
Thank you.

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,770
What is it about that place?

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,550
You want to go there?

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,010
But the winter's coming.

16
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,380
If it gets any colder, I won't be able to move.

17
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,400
Plus, if we leave this house, we probably won't be able to come back here.

18
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,860
You still want to go?

19
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,530
What is there?

20
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:46,160
Many things that keep
every day fun and a warm place?

21
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,340
Why is there a gas stove in the resource room?

22
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,560
All sorts of things that are no longer used,
even those that are not books, are stored here.

23
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,140
A good cook and getting good grades.

24
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,400
Good-looking and kind to everyone.

25
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,230
Watching Yukine-chan relaxes my heart.

26
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,070
Thank you very much.

27
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,450
You're always lively company.

28
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,490
Yes. It's so much fun every day.

29
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,280
How about you?

30
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,950
Doesn't it get boring for you to be here alone every day?

31
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,960
Not at all, since I get frequent visitors.

32
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,250
Visitors...

33
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,050
What's that guy's story?

34
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,760
So what brings you here today?

35
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,970
Of course, I'm here to tell you how much I love you.

36
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,560
I have finally realized my true feelings recently.

37
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,100
This love for you is real!

38
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,440
Thank you very much.

39
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,440
But I think someone better for you will show up.

40
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,150
I got dumped instantaneously!

41
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,400
Plus they're the exact same words as Nagisa-chan's!

42
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,740
Yu-Yuki-nee...

43
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,250
Sudou-san!

44
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,880
Are you all right, Sudou-san?

45
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,050
That was stupid of me...

46
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,760
Because of me, our gang totally lost the fight.

47
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,760
I can't go back to them.

48
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm going off on a journey now.

49
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,520
I'll be a lone wolf starting today.

50
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,030
So I wanted to say goodbye to you before I go.

51
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,030
Laugh at me for being such a sissy.

52
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,530
Hey, this is the school's resource room, right?

53
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,620
I think so.

54
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,410
Should I go get the school nurse?

55
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,290
You mustn't say something like that.

56
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,960
If you leave, I think everyone will miss you.

57
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,210
I would.

58
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,970
Yuki-nee.

59
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,390
I'll teach you a charm.

60
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,550
You do this.

61
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,260
And this.

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,270
Then say, "I'm always looking at you from the side." three times.

63
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,770
If you do, you'll be able to make up with your friends.

64
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,360
I'm always looking at you from the side. I'm always looking at you from the side.

65
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,240
I'm always looking at you from the side.

66
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,700
I feel like I see a ray of light.

67
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,240
What a fast recovery.

68
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,830
I should take note of that charm.

69
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,870
All you have to do now is
to properly apologize to them.

70
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,420
Running away won't solve anything.

71
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,670
You're right.

72
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,340
I totally lost sight of myself.

73
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,430
I always say you shouldn't fight.

74
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,980
Sorry. But there are times when men have to fight.

75
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,320
Hey, could you explain what's going on?

76
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,610
Well...

77
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,740
Yuki-nee's like the big-sis of our gang.

78
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,860
Big-sis?

79
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,160
We're all under the care of Yuki-nee.

80
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,870
Like taking care of us after fights.

81
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,960
Not just us-

82
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,420
I knew I'd find you here, Sudou!

83
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,880
You followed me all the way here?

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,050
This is the only place you would hide.

85
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,920
Prepare yourself!

86
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,010
Please wait!

87
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,600
Yukine-san. I don't have any intention of bothering you.

88
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,720
You've taken care of our guys many times, too.

89
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,480
Sorry, Yuki-nee.

90
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,690
If it's come to this, no one can stop us.

91
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,230
Step outside! We'll bother Yuki-nee if we fight here!

92
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,820
You got it!

93
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,650
Sorry to bother you, Yukine-san.

94
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,450
Yuki-nee, if another idiot like me
wanders in, please take care of that guy.

95
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,250
See ya!

96
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,620
Sudou-san!

97
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,590
My brother is the leader of the gang Sudou-san is in.

98
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,680
Oh yeah, you did say how you have a scary brother.

99
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,060
Currently in this city, two gangs are fighting over territory.

100
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:08,190
My brother's group and the group the person who came later belongs to.

101
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,740
They're separated by a river.

102
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,870
After my brother became the leader,
they couldn't cross the border easily, but...

103
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,290
...little scuffles happen every day.

104
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,380
Your brother is that scary of a person?

105
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,590
Apparently, he's never lost a single fight.

106
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,970
He tries to keep his identity and home hidden to avoid getting attacked from behind.

107
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,470
The invisible leader!

108
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,140
So cool!

109
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,350
What's your brother's name?

110
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,400
It's Kazuto.

111
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,150
Miyazawa Kazuto.

112
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,110
Don't move!

113
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,110
Miyazawa?

114
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,690
You're Miyazawa Yukine, right?

115
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,110
Give me back my sister!

116
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,990
What is this? Are you with the guy from before?

117
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,540
Please calm down, Okazaki-san.

118
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,250
There we go.

119
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,380
What are you doing? Let me go!

120
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,960
Let me go!

121
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,970
Let's talk properly.

122
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,930
Do I know your sister?

123
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,020
D-Don't play dumb with me!
I know you're the boss of the gang!

124
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,480
Stop acting tough, kid.

125
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,570
What are you?

126
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,950
I get it. You must be Miyazawa Kazuto.

127
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,450
I heard that Miyazawa Kazuto has blond hair.

128
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,330
You're the one that rules this side of the city, right?

129
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,540
That's right. I am Miyazawa Kazuto.

130
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,840
But...

131
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,760
It's fine. Leave it to me, my beloved sister.

132
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,050
I'll play with you then.

133
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,010
Me, the invisible leader.

134
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,890
Sunohara-san... Why?

135
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,270
He just wants to act bossy.

136
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,150
He'll be as high-handed as possible to anyone who's weaker than him.

137
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,570
Um, how about we go somewhere we can sit and talk?

138
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,830
Why do we have to come to my place?

139
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,450
Leaders don't care about details.

140
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,290
Yu-kun, right?

141
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,670
Please let me introduce everyone for you first.

142
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,800
I'm Miyazawa Yukine.

143
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,840
Hello.

144
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,130
H-Hello.

145
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,310
They are Okazaki Tomoya-san and Furukawa Nagisa-san.

146
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,060
Hello.

147
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,600
You have good manners, Yu-kun.

148
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,190
D-Don't try to flatter me.

149
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,320
I was hoping for something more savage.

150
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,900
If I'm right, your sister went missing?

151
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,990
She ran away from our house and joined your gang.

152
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,250
I asked my friend's brother, and he said that the boss of the group is the Miyazawa kid,

153
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,330
and the younger sister of the two is a student at Hikarizaka High School.

154
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,340
So you've come to claim your sister back, eh?

155
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,710
You're very brave, Yu-kun.

156
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,720
Miyazawa Kazuto is the invisible boss,

157
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,640
and I'm told that only those in his group know his face.

158
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,350
That's why I came to talk with the sister.

159
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,430
How old is your sister?

160
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,690
I think she was twenty-one.

161
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,860
We got a call from her the other day saying she wouldn't be back for a while.

162
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,450
That she'll lease an apartment and live alone for a while.

163
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,490
Is that something to worry about?

164
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,830
Look. You're just a sis-con.

165
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,870
Sis-con?

166
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,380
When a twenty-one year old leaves home, it's called going independent.

167
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,590
There's no need for a kid to worry.

168
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,170
But she's dating a guy in a gang.

169
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:06,930
Um, I don't know what exactly you were told,
but my friends aren't bad people.

170
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,940
They are a little short-tempered and quick to fight, but they're all very manly.

171
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,360
How about us? Do we look like that bad of people?

172
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,150
You do.

173
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,820
But she looks like a nice person.

174
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,490
Thank you very much.

175
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,990
Not cute at all...

176
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,910
Yu. You're a seed from a flower.

177
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,910
You'll be blown away by the wind and start your journey.

178
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,420
You're on your way to meet new people in new places.

179
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,750
Meet new people in new places?

180
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,840
You can't be spoiled by your sister anymore.

181
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,800
Even if you're apart, you're still connected by a bond.

182
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,180
That's what family is!

183
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,680
Sunohara is giving a proper lecture.

184
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,560
I'm sure he thought things through after what happened with Mei-chan.

185
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:04,320
But I'm sure you'd be worried to not know where your sister is, so I'll ask my friends.

186
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,910
Is that all right?

187
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,200
Okay.

188
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,500
Please look for my sister.

189
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,080
Thank you for your help.

190
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,090
Yes. I'll do my best.

191
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,050
Things were settled peacefully.

192
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,550
I think it's Miyazawa-san's charisma.

193
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
She's wonderful.

194
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,980
How did this happen?

195
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,650
He wants to follow me and learn about manhood.

196
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,940
He's got real guts to skip school for it.

197
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,440
Thank you for taking me in!

198
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,700
If you watch me, you'll learn how a man should be.

199
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,490
Don't fall behind.

200
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,160
Yes!

201
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,960
Hey, the bell rang.

202
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,790
Yeah, it did.

203
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,590
Didn't class start?

204
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,800
As long as you're doing what you're supposed to do, you don't have to attend classes.

205
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,590
That's the law of the society.

206
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,850
Does he do what he's supposed to do?

207
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,720
Not at all.

208
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,010
You don't either!

209
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,680
I have been attending class regularly these days.

210
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,190
I'm here only because of you guys.

211
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,980
Could you two be bums?

212
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,360
He is, but I'm not.

213
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,860
Stop spilling the beans!

214
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,860
You're ruining the dignity of the teacher!

215
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,740
You intended this to be a lesson for him?

216
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,240
You've heard of teachers who are abominable role models, right?

217
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,660
I'm trying to be one.

218
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,910
Do you even know what that means?

219
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,620
No, but the word sounds cool, doesn't it?

220
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,170
Hey, someone's coming.

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,130
Is someone in here?

222
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,600
That idiot.

223
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,270
Way to be found so easily.

224
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,400
The class has already started, you know?

225
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,360
Sorry. I lost track of time playing hide and seek.

226
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,780
Hide and seek?

227
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,360
So there are others hiding?

228
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,490
Hey, Okazaki. Come out.

229
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,530
This is horrible.

230
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,910
What happened after that?

231
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,960
We got taken away with him and got lectured.

232
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,380
It's unfair for only me to be caught.

233
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,130
Hey, is this part of being manly?

234
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,220
As an abominable role model, he's doing a great job.

235
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,050
You could say that.

236
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,350
We got ahold of her.

237
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,600
We know where your sister is.

238
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,570
Your sister wants to see you, too.

239
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,280
She said she'll be waiting at
the store where everyone gathers.

240
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,360
Thank you, Yukine Onee-chan.

241
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,530
Why do we need to come along?

242
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,080
I wouldn't want to get dragged into another fight.

243
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,830
When that happens, you'll take care of things, right, Kazuto Bro?

244
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,800
When bad guys show up,
beat them up for us please, Kazuto-san.

245
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,300
I wouldn't want you to rely on me so much.

246
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,940
It's my first time coming to a place like this.

247
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,610
It's fine. They're all friendly people.

248
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:32,530
Come to think of it, coming here will expose that I'm not Yukine-chan's brother, won't it?

249
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,780
You just realized that now?

250
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,530
I'm going home!

251
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,580
We've come this far.

252
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,330
Come with us.

253
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,080
Hello.

254
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,750
Yuki-nee!

255
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,790
Long time no see, Yuki-nee.

256
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,670
We've been waiting for you, Yuki-nee.

257
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,750
I'm glad to see that you're all well.

258
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,010
Onee-chan!

259
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,800
Yu!

260
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,430
I was worried about you, Onee-chan!

261
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,930
I'm sorry. But I'm doing fine.

262
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,770
That's your little brother?

263
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,940
He's so cute.

264
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,940
He's got a good strong face.

265
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,320
How about it? Want a drink to go with the reunion?

266
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,190
No alcohol.

267
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,950
I was just kidding.

268
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Looks like Sudou-san was able to make up with everyone else.

269
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,910
Miyazawa's really popular, isn't she?

270
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,870
Yuki-nee treats anyone who's wounded, regardless of being friend or foe.

271
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,000
There are many who have been cared for by her after a fight.

272
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,630
You're the guy from that day.

273
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,090
Yeah. Sorry I couldn't give much of an introduction that day.

274
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,340
No, same here.

275
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,810
You got another guy there?

276
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,390
I'm not worthy of introducing myself.

277
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,820
What are you doing, Kazuto-san?

278
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,490
What?

279
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,120
You're still bothering Yuki-nee?!

280
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,670
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm just her friend!

281
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,750
He isn't Miyazawa Kazuto-san?

282
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,960
What? You were lying to me?

283
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,510
L-Look, I'm in the theater club,
so I wanted to practice my acting.

284
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,470
To pretend to be Kazuto-san of all people.

285
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,810
You piece of shit.

286
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,440
If you weren't Yuki-nee's friend, you would be dead now.

287
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:33,940
Calm down. He did take care of my brother, so could you let him off the hook?

288
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,030
You won't do it again, right?

289
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,240
Bro! Sis! I'll follow you forever!

290
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,750
I heard from Yu-kun yesterday.

291
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,370
His family is having a problem between parent and child.

292
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:55,840
The other day, his sister left home
as a result of a fight with the mother.

293
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:01,180
Many of those who are here aren't on good terms with their parents.

294
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,770
They don't have a place for them at home, so they come to a place like this.

295
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,560
So to them, this is like their home.

296
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,610
It is the same with my brother.

297
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,320
He didn't get along with my parents very well.

298
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,530
I was once told that when there's a family-like group,

299
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,040
people don't stray from the path too much.

300
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,460
Apparently her family had a bad parent-child relationship and the house was cold.

301
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,210
What happened to her?

302
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,630
A lot has happened, but apparently they're doing fine now.

303
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,100
I see. That's good to hear.

304
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,390
You're a pretty interesting guy.

305
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,600
A-Am I?

306
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,980
Enjoy.

307
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,940
Thank you very much.

308
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,100
Thank you.

309
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,730
Do not mention it.

310
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,860
Um, won't Kazuto-san be coming here today?

311
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,740
My brother?

312
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,570
Kazuto-san's in the hospital right now.

313
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,030
He saved a buddy and got in a car accident.

314
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,410
Car accident?

315
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:14,290
Kazuto-san was an employee here,
but now a group of us take care of the place.

316
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,960
I'm helping in the kitchen from time to time, too.

317
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,140
Kazuto-san's a wonderful person the more I hear about him.

318
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:29,060
That's right. We can live without going astray thanks to him.

319
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,060
Is there a picture of him or anything?

320
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,230
I'd like to see what he looks like.

321
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,360
I don't have a picture of him,
but everyone says that I look like him.

322
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,070
You do?

323
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,860
Yes.

324
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,250
That was fun.

325
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,660
My life just got shortened a bit.

326
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,130
You should be happier since you got to act like the boss.

327
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,420
You're Miyazawa Kazuto, right?!

328
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,800
What? Me?!

329
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,970
We finally meet! I didn't know you were out of the hospital!

330
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,930
We'll settle this today once and for all!

331
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,640
You're making a mistake!

332
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,310
Please wait! He's-

333
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,020
Yukine-san, sorry but you can't stop us.

334
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,360
Don't hurt Yukine-san and the other girl.

335
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:17,730
Get them!

336
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,440
Crap. Lets get out of here.

337
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,400
Wait!

338
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,370
Wha... What just happened?

339
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,460
That's the power of Miyazawa Kazuto?

340
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,830
It's frightening.

341
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,420
That wasn't human...

342
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,720
You're the ones who came running at me, and what a rude thing to say!

343
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,050
Tomoyo-san!

344
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,100
You saved us.

345
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,970
What are you doing in a place like this?

346
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,560
I heard many fights have happened here recently.

347
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,070
I was on a patrol since I don't want students from our school to get involved.

348
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,190
You guys, too. Why are you in trouble with guys like them?

349
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,410
It's a long story...

350
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,700
I think they totally have the wrong idea.

351
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,000
Looks that way.

352
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,850
Your brother doesn't know what's going on?

353
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,810
Even if he's in the hospital, can't he convince Sudou and others over the phone?

354
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,400
Here's my advice.

355
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,360
Stop being a fool and be friends.

356
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,870
Kazuto-san can stop the fight, right?
