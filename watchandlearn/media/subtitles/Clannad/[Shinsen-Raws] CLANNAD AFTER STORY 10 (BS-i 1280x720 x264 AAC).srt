2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,070
I collect junk and she builds.

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,530
The sky gets cloudier and cloudier.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,460
I hope we'll be able to fly with
those wings before winter comes.

5
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,310
When winter comes, she won't be able to move.

6
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,410
She said so herself.

7
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,260
I'm not sure what that means,

8
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,590
but I think it's something
she can't do anything about.

9
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,260
Bye bye. Take care.

10
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,790
Take care.

11
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,890
I'd like to see everyone again.

12
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,810
I'll hang out with you even if I become famous.

13
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,270
See you again.

14
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,290
Bye.

15
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,660
Congratulations, Tomoya-kun.

16
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,610
Oh, yeah.

17
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,000
Once again, congratulations for graduating.

18
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,300
You are a part of society now, Okazaki-san.

19
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,900
More like I'm a professional bum starting today.

20
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,460
What are your plans from here?

21
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,210
Nothing in particular.

22
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,990
You're unbelievable.

23
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,040
Do you want to work for us for a while?

24
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:48,070
That'd be great. If you would, I'd be able to make a bento for Nagisa from now on.

25
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,650
I've always wanted to, but I just couldn't find the time to in the mornings.

26
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,880
Your pay will be really small.

27
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,340
You'd better be prepared.

28
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,610
Thank you very much.

29
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,930
I look forward to working with you, Tomoya-san.

30
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,460
"Tomoya-san"?

31
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,250
Please let me call you by name.

32
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,700
Since we're like family now.

33
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,980
Really?

34
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,600
If you would work here, I'm sure it would be a big help to both Dad and Mom.

35
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,950
Yeah, but I can't be under their care forever.

36
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,480
The weather's getting warmer, and I'm starting to get better.

37
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,120
I think I'll be able to go to school.

38
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,960
It'd be nice if you could be in the same class as Tomoyo and Miyazawa.

39
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,830
Yup!

40
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,920
Work began at 5 am.

41
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,100
The old man would already be working on baking bread.

42
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,340
Sanae-san showed me the ropes as she set the bread.

43
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,740
Tomoya-kun.

44
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,450
Today's the opening ceremony, isn't it?

45
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,230
Yes. I'll be going.

46
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,580
Yeah, take care.

47
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,320
I will.

48
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,820
Good luck, Nagisa.

49
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,620
The peak hours continue until 9 am.

50
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,540
The day's sales are concentrated during this period of time.

51
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,730
Once afternoon hits, few customers come.

52
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,690
Sanae-san teaches class to the kids in the neighborhood.

53
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,350
It's important income for the Furukawas.

54
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,240
I'm back.

55
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,990
Where did you go?

56
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,910
Just a little.

57
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,390
The old man occasionally wandered off.

58
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,960
No one knew where and what he was doing.

59
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,210
It's boring, isn't it?

60
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,470
Yeah.

61
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,460
I wonder if Nagisa's doing all right at school.

62
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,970
There's nothing we can do even if we worry.

63
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,590
How about we play a little catch using Sanae's bread?

64
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,670
You shouldn't play with food.

65
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,890
Don't so strict.

66
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,680
You should have fun when you work.

67
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,480
Excuse me.

68
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,600
Welc-

69
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,230
Oh, it's my daughter.

70
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,760
I wanted to see Tomoya-kun working.

71
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,240
What class did you end up in?

72
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,980
I'm with people I don't know.

73
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,770
But it looks like there are many nice people,
so I'm looking forward to getting to know them.

74
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,930
I see.

75
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,710
All right. Now that we have more people,
let's have a snowball fight using Sanae's bread.

76
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,090
Um...

77
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,880
Mom's right behind you.

78
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,090
My bread was...

79
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,590
My bread was...

80
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,490
...meant to hit others with?!

81
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,780
I luf fem!

82
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,390
Fanae!

83
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,190
I was slowly beginning to understand.

84
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,610
The old man and Sanae-san always made sure Nagisa was laughing like this.

85
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,660
Tomoya-kun.

86
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,610
I'm off, Tomoya-kun.

87
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,620
Today's the clubs' open house, right?

88
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,120
Yes. I made a script and memorized it.

89
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,570
I see. Good luck.

90
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
Nagisa?

91
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,860
Hey. Did you eat your breakfast?

92
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,810
I polished it already.

93
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,570
Nagisa!

94
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,530
Tomoya-kun. I'm home.

95
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,020
How did the open house go? Did it go well?

96
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,550
Yes. I got good reactions from it.

97
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,380
Nagisa. Tell me  the truth.

98
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,750
I couldn't speak well during the open house.

99
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,250
But Tomoyo-san, Miyazawa-san, and Nishina-san clapped for me.

100
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,300
Have you found an advisor?

101
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,270
Minoshi-sensei from the track team will be advising us, too.

102
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,590
Ah, that guy.

103
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,800
But if I can't get two more people to sign up until Wednesday next week,

104
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,490
the Theater Club will be automatically closed.

105
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,820
I've got to work hard so that doesn't happen.

106
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,640
What's it like in your class?
Do you think you can make friends?

107
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,790
Do people know that you're repeating twice?

108
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,650
Everyone does.

109
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,790
That's why it looks like it's hard for everyone to talk with me.

110
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,110
You're good with people, so I don't think anyone would be annoyed even if you approached them.

111
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,590
I hope so.

112
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,820
I want to continue the Theater Club.

113
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,550
Yeah.

114
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,960
I want to talk about fun things with you.

115
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,460
I want to talk about what happened at school with a smile.

116
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,440
Tomoya-kun?

117
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,900
Yeah! Let's talk a lot about fun stuff.

118
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,990
Yes.

119
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:29,290
I never heard any fun stories about what happened at school from Nagisa.

120
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,970
Saying "Good luck" to her may have just put pressure on her.

121
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,700
It crossed my mind that...

122
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,270
...I might have been pushing her.

123
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,580
But Nagisa was never tardy to school nor did she ever skip.

124
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,750
She continued to work hard.

125
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,080
In the end, not a single person joined the club.

126
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,430
Yoshino-san.

127
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,740
Hey. It's been a while.

128
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,520
Looks like you're really busy.

129
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,960
Yeah. We're short on people.

130
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,520
Since it's a tough job, after all.

131
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,100
Oh yeah. Congratulation on graduating.

132
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,030
Oh right. Thanks.

133
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,780
What are you doing now?

134
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,540
Something like helping with chores.

135
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,360
Come visit us once in a while.

136
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,380
Though, I'm working and Kouko's at the hospital during the day.

137
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,670
Kouko-san's sister's been in the hospital for a long time, right?

138
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,340
Yeah. But she believes she'll get better.

139
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,180
So I won't lose hope either.

140
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,340
Sorry, but I still have work to do.

141
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,780
Ah. Sorry to stop you.

142
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,930
I'll see you around.

143
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,070
It's pretty expensive even if it's far from the station.

144
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,830
Are you serious?

145
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,400
I want to grow my hair long, too.

146
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,320
Tomoya!

147
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,090
Long time no see, Okazaki-kun.

148
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,930
Hey.

149
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,940
Long time no see. Are you on your way home from school?

150
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,540
Yes.

151
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,520
It's been since our graduation. Is Nagisa better?

152
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,780
Yeah. She goes to school every day.

153
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,900
Thank goodness.

154
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,970
We're in the same city, so we want to come visit once in a while,

155
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,890
but we can't seem to find the time to.

156
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,120
We're always saying that we'd like to meet up.

157
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,620
School's that busy?

158
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,910
How about you? Still a freeloading bum?

159
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,460
Onee-chan. "Bum" is a little-

160
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,610
You're exactly right.

161
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,250
I know I shouldn't be like this.

162
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,820
Don't act so mature. You're throwing me off.

163
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,760
Get your act straight.
Do something and a result will follow.

164
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,050
Yeah. I was just seeing if there were any cheap rooms, but I can't find one that easily.

165
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,440
My friend's older brother will be moving out of his room soon.

166
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,370
It's an old place, but he said the rent is very cheap.

167
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,340
I'm sorry. It was uncalled for, wasn't it?

168
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,470
No! Tell me more about it!

169
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,330
Yoshino-san!

170
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,730
Um!

171
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,670
Yoshino-san.

172
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,090
Would you...

173
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,660
...let me...

174
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,380
...work with you?!

175
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,330
Please!

176
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,210
I see. So you're going to leave here.

177
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,730
I'm happy with the choice you made.

178
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,440
Thank you. After all, I have been pampered.

179
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,240
Do you have money?

180
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,700
Yeah. The pay you've given me has hardly been touched.

181
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,290
All right, then I won't say anything more.

182
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,700
Do as you like.

183
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,650
Thank you for taking care of me for so long.

184
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,220
Don't you have to look after the shop?

185
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,940
No one's gonna come at this hour.

186
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,280
You looked like you wanted to play with me, so with no choice, I'm out here.

187
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,600
You'd better thank me.

188
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,030
I'm the one playing with you.

189
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,480
Brat.

190
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,470
What?

191
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,080
Come to me when you have any trouble.

192
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,280
Lots of things happen once you step into society.

193
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,750
Ask for help whenever you need it.

194
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,730
Thank you. Those words are enough for me.

195
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,510
You talk like a real man.

196
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,760
One day...

197
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,860
Can I take Nagisa with me one day?

198
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,020
She's the one who has to decide.

199
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,950
She's not a little kid anymore.

200
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,340
All right.

201
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,090
Give me your best pitch.

202
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,770
I'm called the Babe Ruth of bread around here.

203
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,260
Nice pitch!

204
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,080
You did it again.

205
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,790
Go apologize!

206
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,300
I'm going back to work!

207
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,920
You jerk!

208
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,310
It's really tiny isn't it?

209
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,700
And it's a really old place, too.

210
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,270
It looks like mice live here.

211
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,890
No, it's a very nice room.

212
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,640
The breeze flows nicely when the window's open.

213
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,660
It looks like someone's living here now.

214
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,760
I'll return the car and go straight home.

215
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,170
Sorry to even take furniture and dishes.

216
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,080
It's fine. We weren't using them anyway.

217
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,260
Don't come home too late, all right, Nagisa?

218
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,770
Okay.

219
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,220
See ya.

220
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,670
Great work.

221
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,410
Tomoya-kun.

222
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,270
Um-

223
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,770
I'll make some tea.

224
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,190
You sit and wait, please.

225
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,310
Dango, dango, dango, dango.

226
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,570
Big dango family.

227
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,300
I wonder if the day when we'll live together like this will come.

228
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,740
Dango-

229
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,270
What's was that, Tomoya-kun?

230
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,580
Nothing!

231
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,340
See you tomorrow.

232
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,770
Yes.

233
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,270
Um...

234
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,240
Have you told your father that you've moved?

235
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,450
You should let him know where you are,

236
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,390
in the case anything happens.

237
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,310
You're right. I'll let him know.

238
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,610
Yes, and good night, Tomoya-kun.

239
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,000
Yeah, good night.

240
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,750
My independent life began like that.

241
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,870
I wouldn't be able to rely on anyone any longer.

242
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,970
I couldn't sleep easily that night.

243
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,700
Tomoya-kun.

244
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,690
Please wake up.

245
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,540
Tomoya-kun.

246
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,690
Your work starts today.

247
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,010
You'll be late.

248
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,370
It's good.

249
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,750
I'll come cook dinner, too, if you like.

250
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,990
I don't know when I'll be back.

251
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,920
It's fine. I'll be waiting.

252
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,330
"It's fine."

253
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,510
I'll be waiting.

254
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,720
Good morning!

255
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,030
Good morning.

256
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,650
Um, ah...

257
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,310
So you're here.

258
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,560
Change into this.

259
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,180
Good morning.

260
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,040
Yoshino-kun, is he the one you said will be coming starting today?

261
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,940
Yes.

262
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,130
He's the manager. Introduce yourself.

263
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,950
I'm Okazaki Tomoya.

264
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,180
Nice to meet you.

265
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,710
The first few days might be tough,
but you'll get used to it if you keep at it.

266
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,550
Just be mindful of injuries.

267
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,690
Yes. I'll do my best.

268
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,190
You look different.

269
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,410
What?

270
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,440
You look like a different person from the one I first met last year.

271
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,410
Back then, you literally were a kid.

272
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,190
Do I look like an adult now?

273
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,030
No. You look like a kid
who's struggling to become an adult.

274
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,800
So I'm a kid after all.

275
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,960
They're two different things.

276
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,250
Are they?

277
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,250
There's a difference in how serious you are.

278
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,430
Anyway, don't quit on us in one day.

279
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,250
You'll depress me if you do that.

280
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,890
Please don't worry. My life is at stake.

281
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,520
Put the ladder up against the electrical pole.

282
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,410
Yes!

283
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,350
And wear the helmet properly.

284
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,890
Answer.

285
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,250
Yes!

286
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,450
Don't try to support your body with your arms.

287
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,300
Sit back on the rope. It's safer that way.

288
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,870
E-Even if say that...

289
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,370
Lean into it.

290
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,350
You won't last the day if you waste energy.

291
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,860
You tighten the bolts in diagonal order.

292
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,820
It's a rule of thumb.

293
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,570
You check everything at the end. Remember that.

294
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,500
Yes.

295
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,320
All right. Try tightening this bolt.

296
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,010
Yes.

297
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,790
You idiot!

298
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,910
Sorry!

299
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,020
Failure isn't allowed in this job.

300
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,130
What would have happened if a person had been walking down there?

301
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,410
What if someone important was down there?

302
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,260
That's why you do everything carefully.

303
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,940
Neatly and compassionately.

304
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,710
Okay.

305
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,170
Ow...

306
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,050
Is it rough?

307
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,240
My entire body's aching.

308
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,850
I had confidence in my stamina, but...

309
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,120
Everything comes with experience.

310
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,870
We're going to the next place.

311
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,910
How many more do we have?

312
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,330
Four more like the one we just did.

313
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,390
Goodbye, see you tomorrow.

314
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,850
Bye. Good work.

315
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,730
Ow...

316
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,740
I'm back.

317
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,260
Tomoya-kun!

318
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,580
You surprised me.

319
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,740
Ah, sorry.

320
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,640
Are you all right, Tomoya-kun?

321
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,470
Yeah.

322
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,890
Something really good happened today.

323
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,730
Music class was with the class Nishina-san is in.

324
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,670
Ah...

325
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,550
Nishina-san was worried about me.

326
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,280
I see.

327
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,550
That's great.

328
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,890
You look really tired.

329
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,470
Should you go to bed?

330
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,310
No. Rather than that, let me hear more of your day.

331
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,350
Yes. But...

332
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,700
Good morning.

333
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,300
You're not holding the spanner right.

334
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,010
I showed you how it's done many times.

335
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,040
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,670
I'm sorry!

337
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,510
Have you checked how many lines there are?

338
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,260
I'm sorry.

339
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,390
Why are you apologizing?

340
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,940
Ah, I'm sorry. There's a mock exam on Sunday.

341
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,190
Sorry, when we're already losing our time together.
