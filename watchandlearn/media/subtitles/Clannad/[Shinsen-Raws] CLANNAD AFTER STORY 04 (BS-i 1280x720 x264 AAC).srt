2
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,380
So, what was that about?

3
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,450
What was what about?

4
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,710
Mei-chan's still around, right?

5
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,420
Looked like you two were having fun yesterday.

6
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,190
We spoke about what could be going on after seeing you.

7
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,070
I want to play with Mei-chan, as well.

8
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,320
I want to let her listen to the violin.

9
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,780
I think that's a bad idea.

10
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,620
Kyou-chan's a bully.

11
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,850
Mei-chan's worried about Sunohara-san.

12
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,950
We talked about it last night, but...

13
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,790
But I think that's the only chance.

14
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,550
If he plays soccer again, maybe he'll return to the way he used to be.

15
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,630
Huh? Talk about the impossible.

16
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,540
There's no way he could return to the soccer team now.

17
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,470
I told her the same thing.

18
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,370
You know well what kind of group our Soccer Team is.

19
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,810
It's best you stay away from them.

20
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,480
Yes, since our school's
Soccer Team is a little special.

21
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,490
Are they bullies?

22
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,410
For once, your pet phrase actually fits.

23
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,450
He wasn't in the dorm, either?

24
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,870
No. Even Misae-san doesn't know where he went.

25
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,210
What should we do? Without the actual person, we can't ask them to let him rejoin.

26
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,220
Mei-chan, let's think it over.

27
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,590
I think the chance of this working is slim.

28
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,220
I'll go on ahead and ask them.

29
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,930
"Go ahead", as in to the Soccer Team?

30
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,560
Yes. You two wait here please.

31
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,020
I'll go by myself.

32
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,370
Don't be ridiculous.

33
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,730
How could we let you?

34
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,810
If you're going to go, then we will, too.

35
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,080
Did you just say Sunohara Youhei?

36
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,420
Winter's the critical season for high school soccer, right?

37
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,060
Even a senior should be able to participate.

38
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,740
Could you let him play again?

39
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,960
Shut your trap.

40
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,330
We don't even want to hear his name.

41
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,210
Get lost.

42
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:07,720
Um!

43
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,640
My name is Mei,
Sunohara Youhei's younger sister.

44
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,810
Sunohara's younger sister?

45
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm aware how my brother has caused trouble to you all.

46
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,520
But please!

47
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,490
At this rate, I think he will become a loafer.

48
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,200
So!

49
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,660
He was a loafer to begin with.

50
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,790
Yeah. A loafer will always be
a loafer no matter what he does.

51
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,750
Okazaki. You're the same kind as him, so don't you understand that logic?

52
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,920
And you, too.

53
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,130
You're repeating a grade and are an outcast, as well, right?

54
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,930
Loafers should hang out with loafers.

55
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,280
Tomoya-kun.

56
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,810
Sorry. I should have gone there alone first.

57
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,950
I'm sorry, too.

58
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,570
Both of you had to suffer because of me.

59
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,700
No, we're fine. Rather...

60
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,820
Would you like another cup, Mei-chan?

61
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,150
Yes, thank you very much.

62
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,370
Sorry we came imposing on you.

63
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,640
I had a feeling you would listen to something like this.

64
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,820
I'm completely fine.

65
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,800
Since I have guests with various problems and needing advice that come here often.

66
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,640
Okazaki-san.

67
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:37,310
If it's all right, would you share what happened between Sunohara-san and the Soccer Team?

68
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,220
Can I, Mei-chan?

69
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,450
He started a fight when he was a freshman.

70
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,750
Our school's Soccer Team has a tradition of underclassmen being hazed by upperclassmen.

71
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,740
The hierarchy within the team is atrocious.

72
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,360
Apparently Sunohara couldn't stand that.

73
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,680
The first time I met him was then.

74
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,140
I got in a fight somewhere else and bumped into him near the faculty room,

75
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,960
and we've been hanging out since.

76
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,230
I never knew that part.

77
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,950
Because of the fight, the team had to withdraw from the rookie tournament that year.

78
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,780
Sunohara left the team afterwards.

79
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,540
So the Soccer Team hasn't forgotten what happened then.

80
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,290
If he could, would Sunohara-san be able to enjoy playing soccer in an environment like that?

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,190
I don't know.

82
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,340
But soccer's the only way to get Onii-chan back to who he used to be.

83
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,850
But there's no point in us getting worked up when he's not around.

84
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,810
He's so hopeless.

85
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,020
Have I ever told you the story of my older brother?

86
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,770
You have an older brother, too?

87
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:11,580
My brother would not go to school; instead he'd loiter around party town and constantly get into fights.

88
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,410
He was detained by the police several times, too.

89
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,650
Your brother was?

90
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,290
I never would have guessed.

91
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,250
Siblings can be strange.

92
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,290
But you like your brother, right?

93
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,760
I used to think of him as a scary person, but I understand him well now.

94
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,560
He has many good traits,
but just can't express them well.

95
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,770
He was simply clumsy.

96
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,560
Sanae-san described Sunohara like that, too, didn't she?

97
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,690
I think, too, that Sunohara-san has many good traits.

98
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:57,700
Even if it's not with soccer, given the chance, he'll be the brother you used to love again.

99
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,300
What is it like now between you and your brother?

100
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,210
We get along very well.

101
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,020
Sunohara, what were you doing yesterday?

102
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,540
It's my business what I do.

103
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,600
You don't care about what Mei-chan's doing?

104
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,040
Why are you even asking that?

105
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,480
Mei was with you, right?

106
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,890
I'm busy taking care of matters with Sanae-san.

107
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,450
I don't have time to worry about Mei.

108
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,320
Do you seriously mean that?

109
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,190
Yeah.

110
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,840
I'll leave Mei to you.

111
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,160
Make sure you take good care of her.

112
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,390
You'd better quit it now.

113
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,390
What are you angry about?

114
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,920
I bet Mei doesn't care about me either.

115
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,250
SUNOHARA!!!

116
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,790
Okazaki-kun! Sunohara-kun!

117
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,150
What do you think Mei-chan's doing now?

118
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,260
I don't know.

119
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,340
But I bet you and her are having a good time together.

120
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,800
Ask the Soccer Team yourself!

121
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,850
They'll tell you how much she's thinking about you!

122
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,460
What are you talking about?

123
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,600
You're not making any sense.

124
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,830
Please stop, Okazaki-kun!

125
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,440
What happened?

126
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,110
You wanna fight, Okazaki?

127
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,710
Break it up!

128
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,130
What's this about? What's the reason for this?

129
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,790
What happened, Ryou-chan?

130
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,480
I'm not sure, either.

131
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,320
Tomoya-kun, Sunohara-kun.
I don't think fighting is good.

132
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,900
Tomoya.

133
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,870
Tomoya-kun.

134
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,820
Sunohara-kun, really, what is the matter here?

135
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,340
So you got in a fight?

136
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,850
Yeah. I lost my head.

137
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,790
What's Onii-chan doing now?

138
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,710
He skipped afternoon classes.

139
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,040
He must have gone out to play.

140
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,350
I see.

141
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,600
Are you going to the Soccer Team again?

142
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,390
Yes. After hearing Miyazawa-san's story, I feel like I have to keep trying harder.

143
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,350
I can go alone, really.

144
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,030
I can't trouble you more with this sibling matter.

145
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,210
It's no trouble at all.

146
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,090
No. Nagisa, you go on home.

147
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,960
Why?

148
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,610
You know what kind of
a bunch the Soccer Team is.

149
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,860
We don't know how
the meeting may get twisted.

150
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,090
Just Mei-chan and I should go.

151
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,790
I won't allow that!

152
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,390
I can't let just the two of you go after hearing that.

153
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,920
What would you do if they started to get violent?

154
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,440
If it turns into a fight,
I won't be able to cover you.

155
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,120
If that happens, I'll run away with Mei-chan.

156
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,360
Even if anything were to happen to you,
if I'm there, I can get Mei-chan out of trouble.

157
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,870
You really are stubborn when it comes to something like this.

158
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,990
You guys really don't give up.

159
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,710
We're asking knowing it's impossible.

160
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,730
Please let Sunohara-san back on the team!

161
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,930
It's fine if he can't play in the games.

162
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,480
Just letting him participate in practice is enough.

163
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,140
Hey! Do you see anything in it for us?

164
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,100
We'll just get an extra obstacle on the team.

165
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,550
If there's anything we can help with, please let me!

166
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,480
I'll do anything!

167
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,950
Captain, let's start practicing already.

168
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,900
Forget about them and please come over here.

169
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,440
Yeah.

170
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,120
Please wait!

171
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,990
We know we're being unreasonable.

172
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,650
But please!

173
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,450
We're begging you!

174
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,580
Wow.

175
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,740
I never imagined Okazaki would beg to others like this.

176
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,340
I heard that you'd changed recently, but I guess the rumor was true.

177
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,960
Okazaki-san...

178
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,170
Go be a ball boy.

179
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,340
Thank you very much!

180
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,180
Thank you very much, Okazaki-san!

181
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,320
That was very nice of you, Tomoya-kun.

182
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,760
It wasn't much.

183
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,890
Rather than that, let's do our best as ball boys.

184
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,620
Yes!

185
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,860
Don't overexert yourself,
since you're not very strong.

186
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,880
I'll be fine.

187
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,540
Please watch out for Mei-chan over me.

188
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,050
Go get it, ball boy!

189
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,170
I'll go!

190
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,110
Don't space out, ball boy!

191
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,050
Yes!

192
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,550
Get a move on, you airhead!

193
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,180
Yes!

194
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,330
You dumbass!

195
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,360
Bring it back here!

196
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,400
I'm sorry!

197
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,030
There goes another!

198
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,750
Come on! Hurry and go get it!

199
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,410
Yes!

200
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,730
Move faster!

201
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,260
Tomoya-kun.

202
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,490
They're doing it on purpose.

203
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,690
What's wrong? Tired already?

204
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,540
Nagisa, Mei-chan, are you all right?

205
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,010
Yes.

206
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,150
I'm fine, too.

207
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,510
You guys catch your breath!

208
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,280
Mei-chan!

209
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,190
Mei-chan.

210
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,940
Those guys...

211
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,940
No. It's because I wasn't paying attention.

212
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,700
Mei-chan, you should...

213
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,950
I'm fine.

214
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,450
That was nothing.

215
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,930
Stop wasting time, trash!

216
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,100
Yes!

217
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,720
We're done.

218
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
Good work.

219
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,260
Um, where did the other members go?

220
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,180
They went home.

221
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,170
Practice is over.

222
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,210
We'll listen to what you guys have to say for them.

223
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,560
So, what did you guys want?

224
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,750
About my brother, Sunohara Youhei.

225
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,610
We would like you to let him back on the team.

226
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,100
Ah, sorry. Don't think so.

227
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,750
Who would let a pest like
your brother onto the team?

228
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,820
He is a wuss, after all.

229
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,700
A loser that just barks when he's got no balls to do anything.

230
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,960
A dropout that quit soccer and can't study for beans either.

231
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,680
Where's the reason in helping a piece of trash like him?

232
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,090
How could you...

233
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,100
You guys!

234
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:39,680
Did you guys know that Sunohara knows what you guys are doing?

235
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,340
Apparently he asked one of our younger guys.

236
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,320
But so what?

237
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,080
Your brother didn't show up at all.

238
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,830
You've been ignored.

239
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,700
Despite what his sister's doing for him, he got scared of us and ran away.

240
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,830
He is a hopeless piece of shit.

241
00:14:59,270 --> 00:14:59,960
Mei-chan.

242
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,900
Aw, you made her cry.

243
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,840
You're becoming an eyesore now. Go home!

244
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,690
No... No...

245
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,300
Onii-chan will come.

246
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,630
He'll definitely come.

247
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,220
What won't come won't come.

248
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,220
He will. Onii-chan will.

249
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,680
He'll definitely come save Mei.

250
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,140
Mei-chan.

251
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,180
Huh? Is she an absolute moron?

252
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,190
She is Sunohara's sister, after all.

253
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,760
Here, come on.

254
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,650
If you don't scream louder,
your dear Onii-chan won't hear you.

255
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,700
It hurts!

256
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,650
Stop it!

257
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,190
You bastards!

258
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,860
Hold it.

259
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,530
You want to start a fight with all of us?

260
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,140
Cry louder.

261
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,950
Th-That hurts!

262
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,660
You scum.

263
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,080
Tomoya-kun!

264
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,800
Sorry, Nagisa. I was planning on holding it in for Mei-chan's sake, but I'm at my limits!

265
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,090
Onii-chan!

266
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,350
Come on! Cry!

267
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,690
Don't make Mei cry!

268
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,340
I won't forgive anyone who makes Mei cry!

269
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,150
Why you!

270
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,510
Onii-chan!

271
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,200
Sunohara-san!

272
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,870
Nagisa, take care of Mei-chan!

273
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,090
Yes!

274
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,450
Onii-chan! Onii-chan!

275
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,710
Don't forget I'm here, too!

276
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,260
You guys are insane...

277
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,530
They've got crazy eyes!

278
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,190
Okazaki... Did we win?

279
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
I don't know.

280
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,100
But I don't think we lost.

281
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,000
You idiot.

282
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,870
Who are you calling an idiot?

283
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,790
Who else other than you?

284
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,540
Apologize to Mei-chan.

285
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,920
Why?

286
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,930
This never would have happened if you'd kept yourself right.

287
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,440
You really are a worthless brother.

288
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,180
Are you picking a fight with me?

289
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,680
Basically.

290
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,420
Tomoya-kun!

291
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,610
Sunohara-san!

292
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,160
Stop! Please stop!

293
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,660
You flaming idiot!

294
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,240
Do you have any clue what Mei-chan went through because of you?!

295
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,880
You have to be the one to look after her!

296
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,510
Why you...

297
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,540
You're Mei-chan's brother!

298
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,740
Think more of Mei-chan!

299
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,470
I did!

300
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,850
Don't lie to me!

301
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,310
She was hooking up to a guy like me,
and you didn't do anything!

302
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,860
You didn't worry about her!

303
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,800
I did.

304
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,940
I sure did!

305
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,410
Then why did you leave her?!

306
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,110
If you have an excuse, say it!

307
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,450
I thought it was fine if it's you!

308
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,420
I was planning on hiding and watching to the end.

309
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,670
But because you were being so pathetic, I had to come out!

310
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,920
Tomoya-kun! Sunohara-san!

311
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,840
Please stop it!

312
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,170
You should have protected Mei!

313
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,020
Isn't that the boyfriend's role?!

314
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,510
You...

315
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,730
Sunohara!

316
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,270
You love Mei enough to break up with Nagisa-chan, right?

317
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,480
Then get your goddamn act together!

318
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,440
Onii-chan! Okazaki-san!

319
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,940
Please stop this, both of you!

320
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,820
Nagisa-chan? Why are you here?

321
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,950
You've done it now!

322
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,830
Stop it! Please stop it now, Onii-chan!

323
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,000
Onii-chan! Onii-chan!

324
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,760
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

325
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,950
Mei...

326
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,850
Shouldn't you take a day off from school?

327
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,200
Don't worry. Aren't you the one who's still tired?

328
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360
No. I'm fine.

329
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,850
What happened to your eyes?

330
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,920
They look horrible.

331
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,590
But they look like they're having fun.

332
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,640
We got a letter from Mei-chan.

333
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,850
Not just a phone call, but a letter?

334
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,360
She really has a keen sense of duty.

335
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,860
She asked me to take care of you.

336
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,850
And she also said she wants to find great friends just like us.

337
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:29,040
Yeah, it's often said that you're forever stuck with the friends you make during your school days.

338
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,300
I bet now's the only time you can do stupid things like this.

339
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,660
Probably.

340
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,590
Just six more months left at this high school, eh?

341
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,470
There's the old man.

342
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,970
Crap. I'm starting to get really nervous.

343
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,420
Do you want to stop?

344
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,880
No, I won't.

345
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,200
Since the only woman I love is Sanae-san.

346
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,730
Okay. Good luck.

347
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,540
Father!

348
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,230
Oh, ah... Sunohara, right?

349
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,100
What? Are you here to buy bread?

350
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,370
Father! Please give Sanae-san to me!

351
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,250
What's going on, Akio-san?

352
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,000
"Akio-san"?

353
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,220
Tomoya-kun, you haven't told Sunohara-san about Mom yet?

354
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,780
"M-Mom"?

355
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,250
What's the meaning of this?

356
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,010
Akio-san is my husband.

357
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,850
You sunuva... You dare touch my woman?!

358
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,300
Hold it right there!

359
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,900
I was remembering the first time I met Sunohara.

360
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,440
He was a weird blond guy.

361
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,220
I cracked up just looking at his face.

362
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,630
It was my first time laughing so much since coming to this school.

363
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,630
I wanted to try doing stupid things with him.

364
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,260
From the day we met, we've hung out ever since.

365
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,760
And even now...

366
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,630
We're still smiling.

367
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,550
Yeah, what a coincidence.

368
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,990
You know, if you don't mind-

369
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,010
Who's he?

370
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,520
Looks like he's from a different school.

371
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,770
You made him misunderstand!

372
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,750
There are lots of guys who are fans of yours in my class, too.

373
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,400
It's great that I'm liked,

374
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,360
but I don't know what they see in a woman who only yells.

375
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,710
In this dirty boy's dorm,
you've become an idol-like figure.

376
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,410
Like a jewel in a dunghill.
