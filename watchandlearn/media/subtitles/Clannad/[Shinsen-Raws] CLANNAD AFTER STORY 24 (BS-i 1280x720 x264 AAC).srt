00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,880
Ushio. This is a story from before you were born...

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,530
A story to when you were born.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,690
Your Mommy and Daddy first spoke to each other when we were seniors in high school.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,320
That's when you first met?

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,010
Yeah. We didn't even know each other's name until then.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,510
Sweet bean bread!

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,470
Do you like this school?

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,020
I really, really love it.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,300
But nothing can stay unchanged.

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,140
Fun things... Happy things...

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,960
They can't all possibly stay unchanged.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,060
Even so, can you keep on loving this place?

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,660
Just find them.

15
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,890
Just find new fun and happy things.

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,780
C'mon, let's get going.

17
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,300
That's how we got to know each other.

18
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,220
Mommy was a year older than everyone else.

19
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,820
Um, how can I help you?

20
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,280
Wanted to ask why you're eating lunch out here alone.

21
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,160
Do you like this school?

22
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,330
Not particularly.

23
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,330
I really, really love it.

24
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:55,000
I used to have friends and teachers I got along with, but now...

25
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,290
Did something happen?

26
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,550
Last year, I was away from school for a long period of time.

27
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,590
So I'm...

28
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,340
You're repeating.

29
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,430
Yes, I'm repeating.

30
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,860
All the people I knew graduated,
and only people I don't know fill the school.

31
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,860
I feel like Urashima Tarou.

32
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,860
Note: Urashima Tarou is a story in which the protagonist jumps forward in time and finds no one he knew alive.

33
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,990
Daddy was an outcast at school.

34
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,550
But after meeting Mommy,
things started to change little by little.

35
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,600
Mommy was trying to get involved in theater.

36
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,770
But to do that, she first had to reestablish the Theater Club.

37
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,360
You helped her do that, right?

38
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,450
Yeah. Mommy was so serious about it, I couldn't ignore her.

39
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,580
Even then, Mommy loved the Big Dango Family.

40
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,880
You love it, too, don't you, Ushio?

41
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,130
I do.

42
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,090
Mommy was practicing alone.

43
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,590
She had a play she wanted to perform.

44
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,970
...would you like me to take you?

45
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,900
To the place in this city
where wishes come true.

46
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,320
Then started the gathering of friends.

47
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,320
First to join us was Fujibayashi Kyou.

48
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,870
You know her. She's your teacher at kindergarten.

49
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,370
You can't.

50
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,130
I'm... how do I put it...
not dating you or anything.

51
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,090
Besides, Ryou would...

52
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,670
Stop! Stop! Stop!

53
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,510
Listen to me!

54
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,600
Of course, you're a boy, so I understand you have an interest in it...

55
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,970
Then her younger sister, Fujibayashi Ryou.

56
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,730
She was Daddy's class representative.

57
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,480
O-Okay. I will listen to you seriously.

58
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,190
It's starting to look more and more like a Theater Club.

59
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,240
All girls like fortune-telling at the genetic level.

60
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,740
The smartest girl in school joined us, too.

61
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,830
Ichinose Kotomi.

62
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,330
She turned out to be
a childhood friend of Daddy's.

63
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,620
So nice.

64
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,460
There were many others, too.

65
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,130
Like Sakagami Tomoyo from the junior class.

66
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,340
The path we are taking is still continuing.

67
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,630
Let us both keep working hard.

68
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,010
It's a promise.

69
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,390
Sagara Misae-san, the dorm parent.

70
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,060
Also, Miyazawa Yukine, who was always in the Reference Room to talk to.

71
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,610
Miyazawa taught me the legend that's told in this city.

72
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,910
"An orb of light appears to those who are happy."

73
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,410
She says that getting hold of those will grant wishes.

74
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,910
How about Youhei Oji-chan?

75
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,250
Oh right, forgot about him.

76
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,550
This is the game in the name of love guys play.

77
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,800
In other words, it's a boy love game.

78
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,680
I once worked with Mei-chan, his younger sister, to get him back on the soccer club, didn't I?

79
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,440
If he hadn't been there, I probably would have dropped out of school before I met Mommy.

80
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,700
We all went to different places,
but we still get together from time to time.

81
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,620
They all came to our place last New Years,
so you remember them, right?

82
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,090
Many things happened before the Theater Club was reestablished.

83
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,800
For example, Yoshino Yusuke-san and Kouko-san's wedding.

84
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,260
Kouko-san had a sister who was in hospital.

85
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,930
That'd be your friend, Fuko-chan.

86
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,730
Other than members, we had to find a teacher who would watch us.

87
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,320
There was a fight over
Koumura-sensei with the Choir,

88
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,330
and we even challenged the basketball team to convince the Choir.

89
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,250
In the end, Kyou, Sunohara,
and everyone else joined the club.

90
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:51,000
The Theater Club finally started to move thanks to the work of many people, but...

91
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,590
...after that, trouble emerged for me.

92
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,720
Pops, if you're going to sleep, you should lie down.

93
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,930
Hey, Dad.

94
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,810
Oh, hi.

95
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,810
I guess I caused Tomoya-kun some trouble again.

96
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:15,280
Back then, Daddy wasn't getting along with Daddy's dad.

97
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,950
I left home and decided to live at Mommy's house.

98
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,500
Goodbye, Father.

99
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,500
So my... my bread is...

100
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,920
H-Hey.

101
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,260
It was natural there would be leftovers?!

102
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,590
Like mother, like daughter.

103
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,430
I hope the father is sane.

104
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,350
Hey.

105
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,680
What?

106
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,440
You said what you're not supposed to say.

107
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,020
You don't need to hear about Sanae-san and Akki, do you?

108
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,610
There was a time when we all played baseball at Akki's request.

109
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,530
Both Sanae-san and Akki welcomed me into their home kindly from the first day.

110
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,880
I wasn't too sure what a family was like,
so I was lost in the beginning.

111
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,380
But Sanae-san and Akki were both looking after me from behind.

112
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,140
Mommy was physically weak,
so sometimes she'd be in bed, sick.

113
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,850
Sanae-san and Akki took great care of Mommy.

114
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,360
The truth is always harsh.

115
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,320
The School Festival was coming up.

116
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,410
We started to work hard for our play.

117
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,790
But something came up at the last minute.

118
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,880
These pictures...

119
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,670
I found old albums and diaries.

120
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,260
Okazaki-san, I never knew about this.

121
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,970
I never knew Dad used to act.

122
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,890
And yet... they both gave up on their dreams for me...

123
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,950
This isn't good! Let's drop the curtain.

124
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,580
Make your dream come true, Nagisa!!!

125
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,670
What?

126
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,130
Old man?

127
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,840
Nagisa!

128
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,630
Are you an idiot or what?!

129
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,430
A child's dream is their parents' dream!

130
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,100
So you grant it for us!

131
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,640
We've been dreaming of the day you would make your dream come true!

132
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,770
We didn't give up our dreams!

133
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,350
We changed our dreams to your dream!

134
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,110
That's what parents are!

135
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,690
That's what family is!!!

136
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,650
So... ever since that day...

137
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,950
Every day, while baking bread...

138
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,330
...we've been living, waiting for this day!

139
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,040
If you fail here, we'll be depressed!

140
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Do you hear me?!

141
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,710
You've got a huge responsibility on your back, you hear me?!

142
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,110
Shall I...

143
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,400
Shall I take you?

144
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,410
To the place in this city where wishes come true?

145
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,240
Take us there, Nagisa.

146
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,990
Take us away.

147
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,250
The play ended as a great success.

148
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,210
What was the story about?

149
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,760
A story of a girl who lived in a world that had ended.

150
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,800
We didn't know the title or the author of the story.

151
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,220
The ending of the story was a mystery, too.

152
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,480
Mommy said it might be something she heard from someone when she was little.

153
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,900
But strangely, it felt like I knew the story, too.

154
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:34,500
Then Mommy and Daddy promised to keep walking together.

155
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,970
Right before the graduation, a major problem arose.

156
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,350
Mommy became ill and couldn't graduate.

157
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,060
I was really shocked, too.

158
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,900
I should have repeated, too, after all.

159
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,450
Tomoya-kun.

160
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,540
You can't stop like that.

161
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,620
If you can move on, then you should.

162
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,290
Please move on.

163
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,410
After graduation, I helped
Sanae-san and Akki for a while.

164
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:58,450
But I knew I couldn't do that forever.

165
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,920
So I asked Yoshino-san and
got work at an electrical company.

166
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,470
Obviously, I only made mistakes in the beginning.

167
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,180
I might have given up if it had been the me from before.

168
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:23,310
But I managed to keep with it thanks to Mommy's support and coworkers helping me.

169
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,780
Mommy did her best to keep going to school.

170
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,990
But then...

171
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,660
At that time, there was a chance for me to transfer to a bigger company.

172
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,080
But due to various issues, it fell through.

173
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,840
Again, Mommy was the person who supported me when I was about to give up on everything.

174
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,720
That was when I proposed to Mommy.

175
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,650
But I couldn't get married right away.

176
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,110
Mommy got ill again and couldn't come to the graduation after all.

177
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,080
But for Mommy's sake, everyone gathered and held a graduation for her.

178
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,790
Daddy and Mommy got married right after that.

179
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
We became husband and wife.

180
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,680
Then in Mommy's tummy, a baby came.

181
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,010
That was you, Ushio.

182
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,310
Really?

183
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,060
But Mommy wasn't strong physically.

184
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,570
It's was a big hassle until you were born.

185
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,240
I was told by the doctor that there will be some danger during the delivery.

186
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,580
I have not told this to Nagisa yet.

187
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,290
Only I've been told.

188
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,800
When I was getting crushed from the anxiety, Akki told me an old story.

189
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,970
The trees and bushes enveloped the sick Mommy.

190
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,020
Before he noticed it,
Mommy was returned to him.

191
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,520
A story like that.

192
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,020
Ushio? Ushio?

193
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,480
Did she fall asleep?

194
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
I have a strange memory.

195
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,700
I haven't told Ushio yet,
but she was born once before.

196
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:51,090
In that memory, Nagisa died when Ushio was born.

197
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:06,350
I left Ushio in the care of the Furukawas, and I lived alone.

198
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,820
Then, during the summer Ushio was five.

199
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,910
We went on a trip just like Sanae-san had planned, and at the last destination...

200
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,750
Grandmother told me many stories.

201
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,670
Just as I told you many stories right now.

202
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,890
It was a story from before I was born.

203
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,810
Right now, Pops is back at his mother's place.

204
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,650
I'm planning to go see him in the near future with Ushio.

205
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,620
So we started to live together.

206
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,660
Ushio's teacher at the kindergarten was Kyou.

207
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,500
Ushio became friends with Fuko, too.

208
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,550
Everything was going well.

209
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,890
Until...

210
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,560
What's wrong, Ushio?

211
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,940
I couldn't pee alone.

212
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,440
What's wrong, Ushio?!

213
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,990
It felt like I was having a bad dream.

214
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Of course, Ushio beside me is doing well.

215
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,620
She's never caught any major illness.

216
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,500
But Ushio in that world never recovered.

217
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,400
Right then, something happened.

218
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,750
When I came to, Nagisa was right in front of me.

219
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,170
I was back to five years ago, the day Ushio was born.

220
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,500
It's such a strange thing.

221
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,020
But I think it's something that really happened.

222
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,120
Nagisa and I met in this city,

223
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,580
and Ushio was born in this city.

224
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,960
I met many people in this city,

225
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,130
and I lived through many things in this city.

226
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,720
We'll continue to live being supported by many people.

227
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,970
Right in this city.

228
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,610
Ushio.

229
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,490
Fuko.

230
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,160
You'll catch a cold.

231
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,740
It's about time you both wake up.

232
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:07,300
Shio-chan! Daddy! Fu-chan!

233
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,890
Let's head home.

234
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,390
Mommy!
