2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,000
So, when are you guys going to have the wedding?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,630
When I have enough money for it.

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,020
Why did you marry a poor man like him?

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,560
Because I love him.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,390
Don't be so frank about it; you'll make me depressed.

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,200
I'll be calling you "Father" from now, all right?

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,030
No way! You'll creep me out.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,600
But you are my father-in-law,

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,110
right, Father?

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,650
Then I'll call you "Son" from now on!

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,950
All right, Son?

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,050
Stop that, Father!

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,630
Son!

15
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,590
Father!

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,650
Son!

17
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:36,910
PLACEHOLDER

18
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,950
Father!

19
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,250
Um...

20
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,340
Wh-What?

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,470
What am I supposed to say at a time like this?

22
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,220
Say what about what?

23
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,100
Today's the start of our new life.

24
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,190
Should I be saying, "Ready, set, go?"

25
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,380
That'd be strange, since there's no finish line.

26
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,830
You're right about that.

27
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,240
Since we're going to be living together by supporting each other,

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,320
it's probably, "Please take good care of me."

29
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,290
I want to make an oath between us.

30
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,620
An oath?

31
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,870
Yes.

32
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,410
I, Okazaki Nagisa, will not cry anymore.

33
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,900
No matter the hardship, I will overcome it.

34
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,400
But I may cry in happy situations.

35
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,720
This is who I am,

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,120
but I hope you will take good care of me.

37
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,060
Same here. I hope you'll take good care of me.

38
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,100
Tomoya-kun.

39
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,290
W-What?!

40
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,670
Is it really all right for me to get in the bath first?

41
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,390
Y-Yeah. I'll get in first tomorrow.

42
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,120
Okay. Then I'll take a dip first.

43
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,900
Calm down. I've heard the sound of Nagisa showering in that house many times.

44
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,500
What's wrong?!

45
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,580
I'm sorry. The water coming out was cold.

46
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,160
Yeah, it takes a while before hot water comes out.

47
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,420
Start it slow.

48
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,030
Okay.

49
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,140
Um, I'll try to get out fast.

50
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,800
D-Don't worry; take your time.

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,230
I can't do that. You have work tomorrow, so you have to go to bed soon.

52
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,980
Eh?

53
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,970
Ah, right...

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,660
Of course.

55
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,240
I'll start looking for a job tomorrow, too.

56
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,870
What?

57
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,910
A job. I can't be doing nothing.

58
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,140
Nagisa, are you awake?

59
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,300
Yes, I'm awake.

60
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,180
Are you serious about working?

61
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,430
Yes. Of course, I won't neglect the household chores.

62
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,480
After all, this is my house.

63
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,450
I'll do chores around the house, too. But, is your body holding up?

64
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:45,310
I am physically weak, but I don't want to be a weak person.

65
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,730
I'm sorry; I'm being selfish again.

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,910
No, you're not.

67
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,710
You've never wished for anything grand in your life, have you?

68
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,510
I'm always asking a lot from you.

69
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,970
All you ever ask for are things like playing baseball with the old man and holding hands.

70
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,360
I want to hold hands.

71
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,990
We are married, aren't we?

72
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,760
I bet lots of things will happen to us from here on; amazing things and painful things.

73
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,390
But I'll be able to face them as long as I'm with you.

74
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,240
Same here. As long as you're with me,
I think I can handle anything.

75
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,190
So make sure you always stay by me.

76
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,400
Yes.

77
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,340
I'll always be with you.

78
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,830
This is how Nagisa and my new life started.

79
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,940
I needed to support the lives of two people starting that day.

80
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,160
But rather than a burden, to me, it was joy.

81
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,530
When I got off from work,
I headed straight for home.

82
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,840
To the home where Nagisa waited.

83
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,760
To our home.

84
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,750
I called Nishina-san today.

85
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,580
She gave me her phone number at the graduation.

86
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,090
She wasn't admitted to a college, right?

87
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,340
No. She's studying now to enter a music school.

88
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,930
She said she's working since she didn't want to be a burden to her parents.

89
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,850
Wow, good for her.

90
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,490
I heard she's going to work at a family restaurant that opens next month.

91
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,260
She asked me if I would like to work with her.

92
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,140
With her?

93
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,210
Yes. As a waitress.

94
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,550
I'm also looking for a job,
so I thought it would be perfect.

95
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,290
Well, I guess it's better than going to a place full of strangers.

96
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,040
But let the old man and
Sanae-san know, all right?

97
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,200
I will.

98
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,840
What's on your mind, Tomoya-kun?

99
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,430
What Miyazawa said some time ago.

100
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,580
There's a legend from the early days of this city.

101
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,800
When there are blessed people around, a light appears near them.

102
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,650
I was thinking that a light could be around us right now.

103
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,950
If we get a hold of a light, we can have a wish granted, right?

104
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,450
What would you ask for?

105
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,670
I don't need anything.

106
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,000
You've got to have something.

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,060
Really, I don't need anything.

108
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,930
Actually, there is one thing.

109
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,380
Really? What is it? If you say it, I'll get it for you.

110
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,890
A baby.

111
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,060
Can I?

112
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,280
Hello.

113
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,180
Welco- Oh.

114
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,320
It's you brat.

115
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,370
I got out early, so I had some free time.

116
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,680
I thought I'd show my face.

117
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,280
Really? This is perfect.

118
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,920
I've been waiting for this opportunity the last couple of days.

119
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,400
What are you talking about?

120
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,880
We're going to go see Nagisa work.

121
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,360
Why me, too?

122
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,190
What kind of guy goes into a family restaurant alone and orders a chocolate parfait?

123
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,060
Why should I care?
And why a chocolate parfait?

124
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,570
You never went to the restaurant Nagisa works at, have you?

125
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,560
You don't want to see her in the waitress uniform?

126
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,490
I do!

127
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,980
See?

128
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:44,180
But if I get caught taking pictures as her father, I'd be a laughingstock in the neighborhood.

129
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,450
So I'm going as your friend #1.

130
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,550
You'll be found out right away.

131
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,970
I'll only look like a strange rapper to those who don't know me.

132
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,240
YO! YO! I'm the MC Akio!

133
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,060
I'm holding the mike and am the invincible baker.

134
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,400
Yeah!

135
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,800
You're totally giving yourself away.

136
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,130
Seriously? You mean that? Crap, Yo.

137
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,510
Whatever. Let's get going.

138
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,550
Bro, wait, Yo!

139
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,610
This place used to be a grove; it was full of trees.

140
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,840
Man, things can really change.

141
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,580
Hey, what's wrong?

142
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,560
No, ah...

143
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,980
Let's go in.

144
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,980
Welcom- Hey.

145
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,740
Hey, long time no see.

146
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,790
Okazaki-san, long time no see.

147
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,590
Who is he?

148
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,600
An anonymous rapper, Yo!

149
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,370
I see...

150
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,140
Rie-chan, the manager's looking this way.

151
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,070
Two customers. This way please.

152
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,060
Glad to see this place so lively.

153
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,890
I bet this area will change a lot, too.

154
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,190
What's with that crappy face of yours?

155
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,440
Oh, nah.

156
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,380
It's nothing.

157
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,450
Welcome, Tomoya-kun.

158
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,000
Is something wrong?

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,980
Well, I got some free time, so I came to see you.

160
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,240
So I heard from Nishina-san and Sugisaka-san.

161
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,670
Is he your friend?

162
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,170
You don't recognize him?!

163
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,430
No, this is my first time meeting him.

164
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,120
Here's the menu.

165
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,060
Please take your time.

166
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,510
See? She couldn't tell it was me.

167
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,110
Like father, like daughter.

168
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,700
Leave the compliment at that.

169
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,290
Are you ready to order?

170
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,600
I'll have a hot coffee.

171
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,290
He'll have a parfait.

172
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,090
The largest one you have.

173
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:38,240
One order of hot coffee and one chocolate and strawberry mix parfait diamond special.

174
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,740
I'll be back with them shortly.

175
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,880
Sorry for the wait.

176
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,830
Why do I have to eat something as fancy as this?!

177
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,090
Didn't you want to eat a parfait?

178
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,500
Did I ever utter a single word of wanting to eat one?

179
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,620
You said out loud that you wanted one.

180
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,910
Hey, look.

181
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,240
Furukawa-san is very popular.

182
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,130
There seem to be customers who come here wanting to see her, too.

183
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,700
Rie-chan, she's no longer Furukawa-san.

184
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,340
Oh right. She's Okazaki Nagisa-san now.

185
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,550
I'd call it uniform magic.

186
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,100
She does look extra cute.

187
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,580
Rie-chan.

188
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,760
Hey, what time do you get off?

189
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,380
I'll treat you to dinner, so let's go eat out.

190
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,780
I'm sorry. I'll have to go straight home after this.

191
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,530
Excuse me. I need to get back to work.

192
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,070
Wait!

193
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,960
Let's go.

194
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,660
Yeah.

195
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,260
Go?

196
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,120
Wait...

197
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,160
Don't worry. We won't start any trouble.

198
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,750
Come on. Yeah?

199
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,470
Hey, long time no see.

200
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,590
It's been years; I never expected to see you in a place like this.

201
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,000
You're disturbing the other customers.

202
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,350
Step outside, punk!

203
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,130
I'm never coming back here!

204
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,130
Screw you!

205
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,680
Damn, they got away.

206
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,440
Um...

207
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,880
The manager wants to see you two...

208
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,190
Manager?

209
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,350
I'll leave the problems to you.

210
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,340
Bye bye boo!

211
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,330
Hey!

212
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,910
Sorry for the trouble.

213
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,660
No, I was happy that you saved me.

214
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,230
But when I think about you getting yelled at by the manager...

215
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,760
Don't worry. I won't tell him that you're my wife.

216
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,520
No, I don't want you to do that!

217
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,940
Your wife is a very hard worker.

218
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,030
He knows already.

219
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,750
Nishina-kun and Sugisaka-kun told me about it.

220
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,600
I wanted to greet you since it was a good opportunity.

221
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,610
I'm sorry about the commotion.

222
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,820
Oh no. After all, your precious wife was being accosted.

223
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,540
I can imagine what you must have felt.

224
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,920
To tell the truth, something similar happened before.

225
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,010
That time, she got herself out well.

226
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,850
Got herself out? Really?

227
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:40,600
Apparently she's physically weak and has no work experience, but she's smart and has a strong mind.

228
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,770
People like her are crucial to us.

229
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:50,650
But she is too serious; she is easily depressed when she makes a mistake,

230
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,950
so at times like that, please take care of her at home.

231
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,980
I will. Thank you for all your kindness.

232
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,590
Please keep watching over Nagi- I mean, my wife.

233
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,840
Likewise. It's a pleasure to have her.

234
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,930
Looks like you found yourself a new place, too.

235
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,120
Yes. It reminds me of the days I was working hard with the Theater Club.

236
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,370
You looked good in the uniform.

237
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,460
My friend #1 said you looked cute, too.

238
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,980
I-I'm not cute. Nishina-san and Sugisaka-san are much cuter.

239
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,780
I just remembered something Nishina-san told me.

240
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,460
Apparently a new building's going to be erected at the school.

241
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,560
They're going to tear down the old building.

242
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,140
New students two years from now will get to study in brand new classrooms.

243
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,160
It's a great thing.

244
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,430
No, it's not.

245
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,820
It's not good at all!

246
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,290
S-Sorry...

247
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,440
Is something wrong, Tomoya-kun?

248
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,810
No, it's nothing.

249
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,210
It didn't sound like that at all.

250
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,950
I want to apologize if I said something wrong.

251
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,180
What made you so angry?

252
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,540
I'm not angry.

253
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,690
It just made me upset.

254
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,590
Think about it.

255
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,110
That old building has the Theater Club's room.

256
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,940
It's the place where we worked hard together.

257
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,080
Yes, you're right.

258
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,020
I'll miss that building when it goes away.

259
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,780
Yeah, that's why...

260
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,500
Sorry, I think I'm being touchy.

261
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,250
No, it was thoughtless of me.

262
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,300
I'm sorry.

263
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,840
No, I'm sorry.

264
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,300
It's all right.

265
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,560
I was really out of line.

266
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,960
Why?

267
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,950
Why do I feel so uneasy?

268
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,220
The city's changing.

269
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,960
Both Nagisa and I, and everything around us.

270
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,090
And, when everything completely changes...

271
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,550
Even so, can you keep on loving this place?

272
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,350
Look, they're finally printed.

273
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,170
When did you take all of these?

274
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,110
I went back many times after that and took these!

275
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,820
I put much work into these.

276
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,500
At times, I'd be belly down on the floor.

277
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,900
On other times, I'd be hidden in the kitchen and aim for an acrobatic angle.

278
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,750
I'm surprised they didn't kick you out.

279
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,700
What are the girls up to?

280
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,410
I want to show off my work.

281
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:40,050
I don't know. But Nagisa said she wanted to ask Sanae-san something.

282
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,260
Hey wait, you're going to show them the pictures?

283
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,270
What's wrong, Nagisa?!

284
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,210
Are you all right?

285
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,990
I'm sorry. I just felt sick for a moment.

286
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,280
What? Are you pregnant?

287
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,460
Have some modesty!

288
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,760
Actually, if you were a man, she should be by now.

289
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,330
Looks like she is pregnant.

290
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,370
Eh?

291
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,750
The baby.

292
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,250
Whose? Mine?

293
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,780
It's Nagisa and Tomoya-san's.

294
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,900
Congratulations.

295
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,850
Hold on a minute, Sanae! A baby, so what?

296
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,640
Did a bird drop one off for her?

297
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,270
Or did she pick one up in a cabbage patch?

298
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:33,190
No, Dad. Tomoya-kun and I are married, so...

299
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,940
Wait, she isn't going to say it, is she?

300
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,950
...we are having sex.

301
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,240
To say this so frankly to her parents...

302
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,040
She must be a rare animal on this Earth.

303
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,580
Nagisa, you're amazing.

304
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,150
She hasn't had her period, so I'm pretty sure.

305
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,090
Brat!

306
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,150
Why you...

307
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,350
What a great day!

308
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,060
Th-Thanks...

309
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,540
This is Yagi-san.

310
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,510
She is my friend and works as a midwife.

311
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,830
I'm Yagi. Nice to meet you.

312
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,050
I'm Okazaki Nagisa.

313
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,890
Thank you for coming.

314
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,340
I'm her husband, Tomoya.

315
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,760
She will give birth, right?

316
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,350
When I had Nagisa in my stomach, you said that you'd protect her.
