00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,180
Homemade meals for cats?

3
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,340
I was thinking of making this for Chi.

4
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,550
Look at this.

5
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,310
It says that it's also good for her health.

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,090
It sounds interesting.

7
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,560
What are you doing?

8
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,880
Oh, Chi.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,320
You'd like a nice meal too, right?

10
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,180
Huh?

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,530
When you finish, bring them over here.

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,620
This is quite a lot of work.

13
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,120
Huh?

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,120
What are you doing?

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,130
Chi, it will be ready soon.

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,630
What are you doing?

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,090
Oh! Are you impatient for it?

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,240
I can't see it.

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,850
I wonder if it has boiled.

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,230
Huh?

21
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,170
Is it yummy?

22
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,750
I'm finally finished.

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,070
Gimme!

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,520
Now, Chi!

25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,040
Gimme!

26
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,040
Wait!

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,010
Chi!

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,140
Gimme, gimme.

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,290
Now!

30
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,260
Hey, gimme!

31
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,260
What are you doing?

32
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,160
Hey, Chi!

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,140
Chi, wait!

34
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,510
Gimme, gimme.

35
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,970
We were making Chi's meal.

36
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,550
Could you help us?

37
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,860
Could you take care of Chi till we finish making it?

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,070
Okay.

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,070
It's done.

40
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,600
There, Chi.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,560
Sorry for making you wait.

42
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,460
Huh?

43
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,080
What's this?

44
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,280
It smells good!

45
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,650
It's hot!

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,160
Oh! We forgot to cool it down.

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,550
Yes! Cats won't eat or drink hot things.

48
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,590
Sorry, Chi.

49
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,050
She's angry.

50
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,180
Sorry.
