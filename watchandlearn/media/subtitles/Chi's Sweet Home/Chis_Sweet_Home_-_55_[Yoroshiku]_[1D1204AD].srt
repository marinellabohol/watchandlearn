00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,250
Huh?

3
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,210
Youhei. Well done!

4
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,550
Now, Chi, let's go to the vet.

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,630
Let me out.

6
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,730
Let me out! Let me out of here!

7
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,110
Chi.

8
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,740
Have a nice trip.

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,700
Vaccinations prevent you from getting sick.

10
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,480
That's right.

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,220
It's for you, Chi.

12
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,710
Put up with the injection.

13
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,340
Traitors!

14
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,040
I thought you were my comrades.

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,720
Yamada Chi-chan.

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,850
So you came to have a combo vaccination, right?

17
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,010
Is it all right that she's in a net?

18
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,400
Oh, it doesn't matter how she's held.

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,860
Especially for the ones that get frantic.

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,590
Now, you're a good girl.

21
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,280
This isn't going to hurt.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,650
What are you going to do?

23
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,960
I'm home.

24
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,240
Welcome back.

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,640
How was Chi?

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,340
I get exhausted every time I take her to the vet.

27
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,580
Hey!

28
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,910
What's up?

29
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,690
I've run away from home.

30
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,110
They were cruel to me!

31
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,140
I thought they were my comrades.

32
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,990
You shouldn't trust them.

33
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,080
Huh?

34
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,080
Trust?

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,410
Yeah.

36
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,610
You shouldn't trust humans too much.

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,460
Yes. Yes.

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,460
Shouldn't trust!

39
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,190
Yeah.

40
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,970
Trust?

41
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,970
What's trust?

42
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,790
Hey, come on.

43
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,280
What's trust?
