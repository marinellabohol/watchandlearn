00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,800
Huh?

3
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,210
It's too bad I got a fever when everyone is out.

4
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,970
Water?

5
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,350
Thanks, I'm going to drink it.

6
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,060
What?

7
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,090
Oh?

8
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,280
Chi.

9
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,770
Huh?

10
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,770
Sorry, but could you stay out of this room today?

11
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,000
Huh?

12
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,790
Dad, what's wrong?

13
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,090
Dad!

14
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,340
Sorry, Chi.

15
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,100
Dad!

16
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,720
Dad.

17
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,600
Huh?

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,640
My, my.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,030
It's finally quiet.

20
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,610
I can sleep like this.

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,400
It's a game!

22
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,840
Dad! Dad!

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,240
There was a game!

24
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,750
Patience, patience. It's better than if she's in here.

25
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,890
It's quiet.

26
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,710
It's peaceful.

27
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,770
Dad, what's happening?

28
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,940
I don't know what she'll do if I don't keep an eye on her.

29
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,150
Dad, let's play.

30
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,830
There.

31
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,750
There, there.

32
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,760
Wait, wait!

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,130
We're home.

34
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,740
Oh my, Dad also has a fever.

35
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,850
Chi is sleeping quietly.

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,850
No...

37
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,600
I finally got her to sleep.
