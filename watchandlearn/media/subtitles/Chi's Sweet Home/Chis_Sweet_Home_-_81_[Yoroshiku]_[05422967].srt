00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,050
Huh?

3
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,280
Phooey...

4
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,180
What are you doing?

5
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,720
I thought of going for a walk!

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,310
Doors don't open if you just cling to them.

7
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,520
You have to call a human...

8
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,820
Or open it by yourself.

9
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,450
That's great!

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,960
You'll be able to do it someday.

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,700
Really?

12
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,160
I opened it a bit!

13
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,540
See ya.

14
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,740
Are you going to hang around again?

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,130
I want to go too!

16
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,660
Outside!

17
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,940
It's fun!

18
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,270
Huh?

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,030
What are you doing?

20
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,800
Oh! You should pee in the box full of lumps.

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,180
Your mom will scold you.

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,870
Heh.

23
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,210
It's a marker that says, "This is my place."

24
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,620
Oh!

25
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,920
I'll make this place mine!

26
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,630
You don't have to mark your territory.

27
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,990
Quiet!

28
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,420
It's a game!

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,700
Be quiet and watch what I do!

30
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,700
Okay, okay.

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
That's cool!
