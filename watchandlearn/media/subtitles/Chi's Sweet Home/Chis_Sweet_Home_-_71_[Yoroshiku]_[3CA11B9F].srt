00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,330
What's in here?

3
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,940
Oh!

4
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,060
I'm on top!

5
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,950
It smells good.

6
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,380
This is fun!

7
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,470
It's crunchy.

8
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,720
A lot of crunchies!

9
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,490
I'm full.

10
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,300
Burp.

11
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,360
It's time to give Chi her meal.

12
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,820
Burp.

13
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,740
Come on, Chi, it's your meal.

14
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,030
I wonder what's wrong with her.

15
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,680
Eh?

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,500
Chi didn't eat her meal?

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,520
Yes.

18
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,970
There, this is the finest canned cat food.

19
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,700
Burp.

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,880
Eh?

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,130
That didn't work either.

22
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,890
I wonder if she's sick.

23
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,150
I'm hungry.

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,740
Crunchy.

25
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,780
Crunchy!

26
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,070
What?

27
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,970
There are a lot of crunchies!

28
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,840
She was eating as much as she wanted here.

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,530
So she didn't eat her meal.

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,210
Isn't it great? I found it.
