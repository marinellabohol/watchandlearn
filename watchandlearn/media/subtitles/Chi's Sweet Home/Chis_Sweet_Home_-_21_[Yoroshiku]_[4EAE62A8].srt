00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,750
We have to go today!

3
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,380
Yes! We must go!

4
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:35,880
Chi's...

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,090
health check-up!

6
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,940
What?

7
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,470
If we take it outside, there's a risk of being caught, but...

8
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,470
We have to go, for Chi's sake!

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,130
Huh?

10
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,950
Are we going on a picnic?

11
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,560
Not a picnic.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,350
We're taking Chi to the the animal hospital.

13
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,910
The animal hospital?

14
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,670
We're going to see the doctor, to check whether Chi is okay.

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,050
So it's nothing like going to a real hospital.

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,760
What's this place?!

17
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,020
Now then, it's ready.

18
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,760
Huh?

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,250
Chi?

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,110
Are you in there?

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,150
Come on out.

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,700
Yay!

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,840
This is fun!

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,440
This is fun! This is fun!

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,640
What is this place?

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,440
Youhei, go get Chi.

27
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,620
Chi?

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,230
Youhei!

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,720
Youhei, let's play!

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,490
Huh?

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,580
Gotcha!

32
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,530
No! I want to play more!

33
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,910
Thank you, Youhei.

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,680
There.

35
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,600
Huh?

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,210
Make sure you're not discovered by the people in the apartment complex.

37
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,920
Yeah.

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,840
Especially by the landlady.

39
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,640
Well then, I'll be off.

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,720
What's this?

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,610
Right, all clear.

42
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,650
Left, all clear.

43
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,130
Okay, we're fine.

44
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,460
Be careful.

45
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,170
Chi, have a safe trip!

46
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,850
If they know Chi is here, we'll be forced to leave!

47
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,480
After all, we're really not allowed to keep a cat or dog in this apartment.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,820
So don't speak so loudly.

49
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,470
Okay...

50
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,510
What's going on?

51
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,680
Th-That startled me.

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,490
That was close.

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,000
Will it be okay after this?
