00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,340
I hate getting wet!

3
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,430
Look, I made it.

4
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,390
I think your teruterubouzu will bring fine weather tomorrow.

5
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,440
Yeah.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,940
Geez.

7
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,900
My umbrella was turned inside out.

8
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,620
Help me!

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,110
Geez, I had a bad time.

10
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,460
Welcome back.

11
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,080
It must've been tough outside, right?

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,580
Umm...

13
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,090
Where's Chi?

14
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,070
Eh?

15
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,160
Come to think of it, we haven't seen her for a while.

16
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,440
Chi?

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,950
Are you playing hide and seek?

18
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,630
That's strange.

19
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,430
Chi.

20
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,400
By the way, the wind is really strong.

21
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,240
Dad! Dad!

22
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,920
Chi!

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Eh?

24
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,960
I hate getting wet!

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,970
Towel! Towel!

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,930
Chi, don't move!

27
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,410
I had a bad time.

28
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,380
Do you feel better?

29
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,820
Did that feel good, Chi?

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,940
What's that?

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,750
I-I'm scared!

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,340
Come here.

33
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,460
I'm lonely.

34
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,310
It's all right.

35
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,390
It's scary.

36
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,510
I hate thunder.
