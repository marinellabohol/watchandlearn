00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,740
Yay!

3
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,180
Wait, wait!

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,740
Oh! Looks like you're having fun.

5
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,270
It's the landlady.

6
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:45,980
Huh?

7
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,240
Yamada-san?

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,360
Yes.

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,190
Dad, please take care of her!

10
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,240
Yamada-san.

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,050
It's me, the landlady.

12
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,740
Yes. Good afternoon.

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,500
Is the Yamada family having any problems?

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,710
Let me go!

15
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,460
N-No. We're not having any...

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,820
How could we be having problems?

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,470
If that's the case, it's fine.

18
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,270
Oh my! Sorry to interrupt your teatime.

19
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,420
Oh! This is just... I was in a panic...

20
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,390
In a panic?

21
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,070
No, I mean...

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,440
"Tea. Would you like some tea?" That's what I was thinking...

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,110
Oh! Thank you.

24
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,400
Then let's talk inside.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,620
Thanks for inviting me.

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,920
We have to hide Chi's toys.

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,100
Youhei, please help.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,880
Okay.

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,420
I'll play too.

30
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,090
Oh, Chi's fur...

31
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,240
Umm... Now is a bit...

32
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,290
It's a bit untidy...

33
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,100
I don't mind.

34
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,020
It's very tidy.

35
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,690
W-Welcome.

36
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,320
Good afternoon, madam.

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,190
Thanks for inviting me.

38
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,730
Please sit here.

39
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,700
Thank you.

40
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,990
Please, please.

41
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,400
Really, thank you for inviting me.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,720
N-No problem.

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,720
No problem...

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,930
Chi, let's wait here patiently, okay?

45
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,340
Youhei, are we going to play here?
