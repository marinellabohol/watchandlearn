00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,530
Huh?

3
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,530
Vroom-vroom.

4
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,990
Vroom.

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,180
Youhei, good night.

6
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,190
Vroom.

7
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,230
Yay.

8
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,690
Youhei left, so he's no good.

9
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,070
Dad, good night.

10
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,640
Sorry, Chi.

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,380
Huh?

12
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,720
I have a deadline approaching soon.

13
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,780
I finally finished cleaning the bathroom.

14
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,860
I'm worn out.

15
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,940
Isn't there any good place?

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,740
Ah!

17
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,480
Huh?

18
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,580
Mom, good night.

19
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,060
What's that?

20
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,860
I wonder what it is.

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,760
Huh?

22
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,980
Chi, what are you doing?

23
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,160
Oh!

24
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,740
Is this what the cat book called "kneading"?

25
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,130
I wonder if she's remembering her mother.
