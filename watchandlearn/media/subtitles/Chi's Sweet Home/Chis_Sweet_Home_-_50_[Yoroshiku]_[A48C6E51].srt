00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,670
What's this?

3
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,370
See you.

4
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,220
Huh?

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,220
Where are you going?

6
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,540
Hey, where are you going?

7
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,920
Hey.

8
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,650
Come this way.

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,070
Huh?

10
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,070
Hide and seek?

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,070
Hey, are we playing hide and seek?

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,590
What are you doing?!

13
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,680
I hate those.

14
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,430
That was a scary game of hide and seek.

15
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,280
I have to get better at hide and seek!

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,420
You're fine.

17
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,470
If you're in a high place, they aren't scary.

18
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,450
Eh?

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,790
Chi can't climb!

20
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,650
It's all right.

21
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,110
Someday, you'll be able to.

22
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,010
Really?!

23
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,280
Yeah.

24
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,620
You're a cat, right?

25
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,450
A cat?

26
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,460
See you.

27
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,610
You're wrong!

28
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm not a cat!

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,640
I'm Chi!
