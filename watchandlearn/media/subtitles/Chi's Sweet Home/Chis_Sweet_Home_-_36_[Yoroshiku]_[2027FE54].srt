00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,180
It's open!

3
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,340
Yay!

4
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,240
I can see outside!

5
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,280
Eh?

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,940
The big cat from before was here?

7
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,400
That's right.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,280
Apparently it was in the window.

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,790
My, how careless.

10
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,910
Having it in such an easy place to find.

11
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,600
No, I mean,

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
I wonder who's keeping it?

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,990
Indeed.

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,780
Huh?

15
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,000
Is something up?

16
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,250
In your window...

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,070
In the window?

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,380
There's a small cat!

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:06,750
Eh?

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,180
There's a small cat there.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,930
N-No way.

22
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,860
Aren't you mistaken?

23
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,670
Because we're not allowed to keep cats here.

24
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,960
There's no mistake.

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,760
In the bay window.

26
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,770
Look, there's a small cat.

27
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,240
A small cat...

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,370
A small cat...

29
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,410
A cat... A cat...

30
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,440
In the bay window, a small cat...

31
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,410
Oh my, look closer!

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,530
Oh my!

33
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,530
It's a stuffed toy!

34
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,530
So it is! It's a stuffed toy!

35
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,290
My mistake.

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,420
A stuffed toy...

37
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,590
Youhei, I need to do some work,
so go play with Chi.

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,640
Okay!

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,470
Chi, you shouldn't chew on that.

40
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,690
What's...

41
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,730
Ah!

42
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,900
It was an impulse buy.

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,110
Well, it's cute because it sort of looks like Chi.

44
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,820
Are you angry that I bought it on impulse?

45
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:22,830
Well done!

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,330
Eh?

47
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,650
Oh my, it's looking busy.

48
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,260
Sure is.

49
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,090
I've camouflaged her!

50
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,600
Isn't that great, Chi?

51
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,230
It's gotten really fancy.

52
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,600
Even though it's my workroom.
