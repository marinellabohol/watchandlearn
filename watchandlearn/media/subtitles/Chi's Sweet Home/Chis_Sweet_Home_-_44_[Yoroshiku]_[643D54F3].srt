00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,810
The strange cat came again!

3
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,780
It ate all of Chi's dinner!

4
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,770
She seems pretty lively today.

5
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,900
She sure is.

6
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,380
Even though I gave her this much dry food,

7
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,850
she ate all of it.

8
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,650
Oh?

9
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,150
There was only Chi at home, so I did my best!

10
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,070
To be able to eat that much...

11
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,470
You're pretty amazing, Chi.

12
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,450
Did you understand, Dad?

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,740
I see.

14
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,760
It was that delicious?

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,540
Dinner's ready.

16
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,330
Let's eat!

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,260
I'm starving!

18
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,760
Huh?

19
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,470
Chi doesn't have any dinner!

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,010
What about Chi's dinner?

21
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,010
She isn't having any.

22
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,980
Since she ate so much at lunch.

23
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,730
We don't want to upset her stomach.

24
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,930
That reminds me.

25
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,370
That big cat seems to break flower pots and steal sliced salmon.

26
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,460
Eh? That's amazing.

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,700
What kind of cat was it?

28
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,200
I didn't have lunch!

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,830
It had a face like that.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,960
It was black, short, and stout.

31
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,500
The stranger came swaggering in.

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,170
It had scary eyes.

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,960
It walked slowly.

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,210
It stared sharply.

35
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,420
It scared me.

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,720
And it crunched Chi's dinner!

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,930
And it's huge!

38
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,510
Got it?

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,790
Sort of...

40
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,350
As I thought, it's hard to understand without seeing the real thing.

41
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,880
That's it!

42
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,160
This is it!

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,530
A cat like this one!

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,250
Eh?!

45
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,010
That's him!

46
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,910
That's him!

47
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,980
A bear?!

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,340
A bit different, but you get the idea.

49
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,420
Do you get it, Dad?

50
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,550
Dad, do you get it?

51
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,690
Yeah, I've got it.

52
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,440
Isn't that great, Youhei.

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,610
Yay!

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Huh?

55
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,460
What about Chi's dinner?
