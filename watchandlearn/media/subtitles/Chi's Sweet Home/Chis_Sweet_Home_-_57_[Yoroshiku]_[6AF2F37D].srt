00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,400
Huh?

3
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,580
This is fun!

4
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,460
Chi!

5
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,200
You mustn't play with the laundry.

6
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,410
This is fun!

7
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,550
Mom, this is fun.

8
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,100
Now, Chi.

9
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,330
You'll get it dirty, even though I went through a lot of trouble washing it.

10
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,760
There.

11
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,240
No, Chi.

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,570
There!

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,990
Chi, didn't I say no?

14
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,860
Geez.

15
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,780
Youhei, you'd better go in soon.

16
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,210
The wind is getting stronger.

17
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,990
Okay.

18
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,440
You need to pick up your toys.

19
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,210
Okay.

20
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,650
Chi, let's go in.

21
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,920
A storm is coming.

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,750
Huh?

23
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,920
A storm...

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,960
is coming.

25
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,700
A storm?

26
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,140
Whoosh, whoosh, bam, bam, rustle, rustle.

27
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,600
Whoosh, whoosh, bam, bam, rustle, rustle!

28
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,780
This is fun!
