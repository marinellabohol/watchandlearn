00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,060
Kitty!

3
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,660
Nyanko?

4
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,670
Nameless kitty!

5
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,780
Hey, should we give it a name?

6
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,720
No, no.

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,270
It's not like we'll keep it.

8
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,680
Found you!

9
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,690
Pee?

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,920
Eh?

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,480
I'm busy at the moment.

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,540
Mom!

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,220
Kitty's peeing in the box!

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,080
Oh my!

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,620
I'm going to go pee too!

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,670
Is that so?

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,070
You peed in the litter box, eh?

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,530
That's a good kitty!

19
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,960
Ah, that's right!

20
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,750
Chi?

21
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,340
Here you go.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,510
Milk!

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,060
Mom! Mom!

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,910
I peed properly too!

25
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,680
I didn't leak!

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,540
Oh! That's great!

27
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,160
I peed!

28
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,320
Chi?

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,830
Dad! Dad!

30
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,470
I didn't leak pee!

31
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,420
I peed properly!

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,690
Chi?

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,180
Very good, that's great, Youhei.

34
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,100
What's "chi"?

35
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,240
Ah-ha!

36
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,830
Now then, what's this?

37
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,040
Giving away a cute kitten.

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,060
Due to current circumstances, I'm no longer able to keep it.

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,890
What's this?!

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,620
They're all "Please take"!

41
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,170
Pee!

42
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,400
You called?

43
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,740
Hmm?

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,460
Chi?

45
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,830
You did  call!

46
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
Chi!

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,510
Just as I thought.

48
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,350
Note: In Japanese, "chi" means "pee".

49
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,090
Chi.

50
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,350
What is it?

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,790
See.

52
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,560
It seems to think "Chi" is its name.

53
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,970
Its name's been decided!
