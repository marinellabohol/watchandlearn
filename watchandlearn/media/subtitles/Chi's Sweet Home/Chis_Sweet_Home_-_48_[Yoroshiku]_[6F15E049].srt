00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,210
Something weird is going on.

3
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,040
What should I do?

4
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,050
That's it!

5
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,980
How about this?

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,440
I wonder if Chi is okay.

7
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,300
She's fine!

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,380
She's house-sitting properly.

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,350
Let go!

10
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,000
Let go!

11
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,910
Huh? Huh?

12
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,970
Let go!

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,410
Thank goodness.

14
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,570
Something weird is going on.

15
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,640
Something weird is going on!

16
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,010
It came off!

17
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,120
That surprised me.

18
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,240
They'll be mad at me!

19
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,810
What should I do?

20
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,160
Feign ignorance!

21
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,760
We're home.

22
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,750
The door to Dad's room is open.

23
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,630
Just as I thought, I forgot to close it.

24
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,630
What's this?!

25
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,420
What on earth happened?

26
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,550
Oh my.

27
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,800
The packing tape is full of fur.

28
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,810
This is Chi's doing.

29
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,440
Chi...

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,540
Chi didn't do anything!
