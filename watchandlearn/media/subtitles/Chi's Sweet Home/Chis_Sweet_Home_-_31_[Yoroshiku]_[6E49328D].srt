00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,860
I'm stuffed.

3
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,300
It's been a while since we've all gone out.

4
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,020
That's right.

5
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,310
The weather is good too. Isn't that great?

6
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,260
Huh?

7
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,360
What's wrong?

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,270
I was just wondering whether Chi will really be okay house-sitting all alone.

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,770
She'll be fine.

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,870
We arranged everything carefully.

11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,690
That's right.

12
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,780
Well then, let's go.

13
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,880
Huh?

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,330
What is it?

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,950
Did we close the door to the bathroom?

16
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,240
It would be dangerous if Chi fell into the bath.

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,450
That's true.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,070
But it should be closed.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,460
Hmm, sorry.

20
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,960
I'm going to check.

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,170
What a worrywart.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,990
All right.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:24,930
Chi.

24
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,420
Be a good girl and wait.

25
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,210
Sorry to keep you waiting!

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,150
It was all right.

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,110
Now then, shall we go?

28
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,910
Yeah!

29
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,440
Huh?

30
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,980
Did we remove the hot water from the electric kettle?

31
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,780
Oh! Did we put the knives away?

32
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,980
We did it all properly.

33
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,490
Hmm...

34
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,670
I'm going to check-

35
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,000
Dad!

36
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,340
I'm worried!

37
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,640
What's this?

38
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,980
What's this?!

39
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,690
They'll get mad at me!

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,240
Run away!

41
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,930
Huh?

42
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,190
Everyone's gone out.

43
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,380
There's nobody here!

44
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,880
Yay! They won't get mad at me!

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,390
They won't get mad at me, no matter what I do!

46
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,010
They won't get mad at all!

47
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,030
This is fun!
