00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,590
Gotta pee!

3
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,760
Where should I go?

4
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,740
Where should I go?

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,180
Where should I go?!

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,400
It got me again!

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,820
Kitty leaked pee!

8
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,020
What?

9
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,370
What? What?

10
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,140
Hey!

11
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,620
Ah, that startled me.

12
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,620
What is she barking about?

13
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,390
I'm home!

14
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,390
Kitty is peeing here and there?

15
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,050
Just when I thought Youhei's problems with the toilet were decreasing...

16
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,990
Now we have to worry about training the kitty.

17
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,490
Is that so?

18
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,860
This fellow is a baby after all.

19
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,330
I wonder if we should buy actual kitty litter?

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,750
Of course, it's just until we can find a new owner for it...

21
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,020
Ooh, gotta pee.

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,080
Where? Where? Where should I go?

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,490
Can't we get through somehow with the shredded newspaper?

24
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,260
But, it's done it so many times today.

25
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,690
Even in the laundry that I'd washed and dried.

26
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,990
Well, but a kitty wouldn't know about things like laundry.

27
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,000
The laundry was left out over there, so it can't be helped.

28
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,440
Do you have to put it like that?

29
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,740
Eh?

30
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,990
B-But it's true, right?

31
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,630
Hold on a second, Dad...

32
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,740
Pee!

33
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,610
Hmm?

34
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,610
Eh?

35
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,340
What's wrong?

36
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,610
You can go to the toilet by yourself, right, Youhei?

37
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,480
Pee!

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,330
Eh?

39
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,190
M-My favorite bag...

40
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,130
I-It got me...

41
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,300
Cover with sand!

42
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,490
It was left out over there, so it can't be helped, right?

43
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,520
All right!

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,900
I'm going to buy kitty litter, right now!

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,990
Eh?

46
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,140
Right now?

47
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,330
I peed properly!
