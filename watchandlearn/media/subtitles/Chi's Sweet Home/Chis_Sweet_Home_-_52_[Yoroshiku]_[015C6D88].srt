Which way is home?

3
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,350
This way?

4
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,190
This way?

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,990
In situations like that...

6
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,130
look at the sky.

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,020
The sun will tell you where you are.

8
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,980
Which way is home?

9
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,980
It's definitely this way!

10
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,440
I'm going home!

11
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,980
This way!

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,330
Home is this way!

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,710
This way!

14
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,490
It's home!

15
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,070
Youhei, I'm home.

16
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,530
Chi had an adventure!

17
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,950
Chi?

18
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm home!

19
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,710
Mom, I'm home!

20
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm home!

21
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,710
Dad, I'm home!

22
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,200
Oh my.

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,130
Chi's in a good mood.

24
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,480
I wonder if something good happened?

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,630
Mom, Dad, welcome home.

26
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,730
Huh?

27
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,310
This is Chi's home,
and for Chi's comrades too!

28
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,450
Everyone, I'm home!
