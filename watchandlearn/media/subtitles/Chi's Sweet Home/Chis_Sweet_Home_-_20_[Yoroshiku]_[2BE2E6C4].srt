00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,010
This is fun!

3
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,800
I'm making this my home!

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,510
Ah!

5
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,010
It's the kitty we saw at midday!

6
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,720
Let's play!

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,600
I wonder if it wants to play again.

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,400
Norio, Tomoko.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,270
We're going.

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,320
Okay!

11
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,530
Now, let's go home and have dinner.

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,400
Okay!

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,530
That's okay. Chi will go over there.

14
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,460
Huh?

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,340
Huh?

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,680
Everyone went home.

17
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,930
What about me?

18
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,230
Hey!

19
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,650
That's okay.

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,340
I'm scared!

21
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,970
I'm hungry.

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,390
Chi!

23
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,640
Chi!

24
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,890
Chi!

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,640
Chi!

26
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,770
Chi!

27
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,900
Chi!

28
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,820
Chi!

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,860
Chi, where are you?

30
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,190
Come on out!

31
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,570
Chi!

32
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,860
Chi!

33
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,570
Chi!

34
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,620
Chi!

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,990
Chi!

36
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,200
It's Youhei and family!

37
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,490
Chi!

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,750
Chi!

39
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,420
Chi!

40
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,590
My goodness, you had us worried.

41
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,680
Chi!

42
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,390
But, I'm glad you're safe.

43
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,640
Well then, should we go home?

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,390
Yeah!

45
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,890
Chi, let's go home.

46
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,230
I'm going home!
