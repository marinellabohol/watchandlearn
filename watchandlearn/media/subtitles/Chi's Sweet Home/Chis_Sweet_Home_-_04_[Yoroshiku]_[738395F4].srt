00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,350
I'm going home!

3
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,770
Well you see, we've taken in a kitty, but could you keep it?

4
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,370
Milk!

5
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,460
Is that so?

6
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,070
Well then, I'll try somebody else.

7
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,120
I'm full!

8
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,660
It's difficult to find someone who'll keep it.

9
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,930
I'm going home!

10
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,220
Huh? Huh?

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,700
What's that, I wonder?

12
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,530
Aw, I can't see!

13
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,360
Huh?

14
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,320
Huh?

15
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,760
That's right!

16
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,340
I'm going home!

17
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,470
Ah, that was fun!

18
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,440
Huh?

19
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,460
Am I forgetting something?

20
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,420
Umm... Umm...

21
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,920
Mom!

22
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,870
Kitty is in the doorway!

23
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,070
Oh my.

24
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,340
Sound asleep!
