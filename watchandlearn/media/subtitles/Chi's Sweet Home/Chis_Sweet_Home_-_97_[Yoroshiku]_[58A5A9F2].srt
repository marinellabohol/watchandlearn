00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,600
Eh?

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,670
Chi did?

4
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,950
The landlady found her.

5
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,860
That black bear cat

6
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,260
even made sure that Chi got back home.

7
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,280
Chi was somehow okay, but...

8
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,400
I'll play with Blackie over there too!

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,150
Huh?

10
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,130
I'm stuck.

11
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,430
I can't get it off.

12
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,070
I got it off!

13
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,960
I'm stuck!

14
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,370
I got it off!

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,470
Huh?

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,110
What's going on?!

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,020
I'm tired.

18
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,660
Run!

19
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,310
Run!

20
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,220
I can't give up!

21
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,450
Huh?

22
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,740
How far does Chi have to go?!

23
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,140
It's no good!

24
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,800
When you go forward,

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,680
you mustn't look down!

26
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,940
Smile and look forward!

27
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,560
Go for it, Chi!

28
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,680
Go for it, Chi!

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,620
Huh?

30
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,840
What are you doing, Chi?

31
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,360
Go for it, Chi!

32
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,690
My, my.

33
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,690
Chi.

34
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,840
Dear me.

35
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,920
It's okay now.

36
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,230
Chi did her best!

37
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,020
Good.

38
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,580
Chi did her best!
