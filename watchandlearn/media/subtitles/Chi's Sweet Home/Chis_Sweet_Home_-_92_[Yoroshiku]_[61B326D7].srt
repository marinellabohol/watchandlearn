00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,800
Juri-chan sure is energetic.

3
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,050
She was brought up in Hokkaido, after all.

4
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,890
Hey, this is a horse.

5
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,190
Ah, Chi.

6
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,840
Huh?

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,230
Chi, come here.

8
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,400
Chi?

9
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,160
What should we play this time?

10
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,080
What?

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,850
You want me to play with you?

12
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,020
Oh.

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,910
It looks like Chi's taken a liking to Juri-chan.

14
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,540
Chi! Let's play!

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,990
Chi, wait a minute.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,590
What, what?

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,580
All right!

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,940
Chi, here we go!

19
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,040
There!

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,430
Yay!

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,350
I got it!

22
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,310
Chi! Bring it back!

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,370
I got it!

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,940
Bring it back!

25
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,460
Gee, a dog would've brought it back.

26
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,050
There!

27
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,610
Yay!

28
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,130
This time, bring it back!

29
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,620
I got it!

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,620
Come on, you need to bring it back.

31
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,580
This time, bring it back.

32
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,520
There!

33
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,750
There we go.

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,250
Are you going for a walk?

35
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,450
Is it okay to keep a cat in this apartment?

36
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,430
Negative.

37
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,120
If something happens, we'll take her to our place.

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,760
Huh?

39
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,630
Thank you.

40
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,980
If something happens...

41
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,660
Chi would come to our place?

42
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,710
No, we were only talking about a worst case.

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,490
Bye-bye!

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,990
See you later.

45
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,410
We'll take her to our place.

46
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,210
Youhei!

47
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,140
Youhei! Let's play!

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,610
Chi, you won't go anywhere, right?

49
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,480
Chi...

50
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,640
Hey, hey, let's play!
