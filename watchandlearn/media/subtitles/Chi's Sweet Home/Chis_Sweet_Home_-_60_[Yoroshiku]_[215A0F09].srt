00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,080
Oh.

3
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,960
Oh?

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,150
It's a power outage.

5
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,850
I'm scared.

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,030
I wonder where I put the flashlight.

7
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,900
Where indeed?

8
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,120
Is it in here?

9
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,620
No!

10
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,690
Please stay calm, Chi.

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,130
Dad, what are you doing?

12
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,880
Oh, here it is.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,050
Oh.

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,680
It's working.

15
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,890
Huh?

16
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,310
Oh my.

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,530
Chi is playing.

18
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,530
She seems to be having fun.

19
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,530
There.

20
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,120
There.

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,660
There.

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,620
There.

23
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,580
There.

24
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,550
There you go, Chi.

25
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,540
There.

26
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,120
I want to do it too!

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,950
There.

28
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,320
Me too!

29
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,110
There.

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,760
There.

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,610
A power outage once in a while seems to be okay.

32
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,190
There.

33
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,590
Oh!

34
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,660
The lights are back on.

35
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,050
Thank goodness.

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,620
Huh?

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,460
It's gone.

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,240
Is she...

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,360
It seems she wants to play a bit more.

40
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,760
Yeah.

41
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,740
Oh!

42
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,220
That's my game!

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,940
Wait, wait.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,290
Wait.

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,290
This is fun!
