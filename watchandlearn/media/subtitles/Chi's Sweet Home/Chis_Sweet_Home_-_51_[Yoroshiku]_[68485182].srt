00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,000
Where... is this?

3
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,170
Huh?!

4
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,990
Well then...

5
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,570
I'm going now.

6
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,510
Where are you going?

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,410
I'm off to patrol my territory.

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,910
Are you going to a nice place?

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,100
Yeah, that's right.

10
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,070
Won't you get lost?

11
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,420
Lost?

12
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,380
In situations like that...

13
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,430
look at the sky.

14
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,050
The sun will tell you where you are.

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,180
The sun?

16
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,370
It's bright!

17
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,190
See you.

18
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,900
Huh?

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,310
That black guy left.

20
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,450
Chi will go home!

21
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,320
Something bad is coming!

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,960
It's coming this way!

23
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,940
What should I do?

24
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,270
That's right!

25
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,300
Hide and seek!

26
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,970
Chi did it!

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,310
Hide and seek is amazing!

28
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,910
Umm...

29
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,280
Which way is home?
