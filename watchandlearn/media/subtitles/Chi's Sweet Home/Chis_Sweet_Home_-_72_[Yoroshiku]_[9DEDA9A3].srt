Thanks for the food!

3
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,610
This is yummy.

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,930
We're having quite a dinner tonight.

5
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,320
Youhei, what's that?

6
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,530
This?

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,720
It's a spoon.

8
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,120
It smells good!

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,590
Only smell?

10
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,620
This egg custard is also yummy.

11
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,060
Thank you.

12
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,880
Eh?

13
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,630
This?

14
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,140
Does it taste good?

15
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,540
I'll give you only a bit.

16
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,310
Yummy!

17
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:27,950
Chi.

18
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,700
How about this?

19
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,940
It tastes good.

20
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,110
There.

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,590
Yummy!

22
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,500
There's a lot...

23
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,150
of yummy food up there!

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,410
This tastes good too.

25
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,590
Yummy!

26
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,890
Really?

27
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,760
Thank you.

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,190
Please make it again.

29
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,270
Okay.

30
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,170
Does she still want something?

31
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,180
I wonder if we gave her too much.

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,850
Is it bad to give food to Chi?

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,400
Some things that people eat aren't good for cats.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,980
Yummy things.

35
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,450
No, no.

36
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,450
I want yummy things too!

37
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,470
Oh, I have an idea.

38
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,440
There you go, Chi.

39
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,460
Here's your meal.

40
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,760
It's yummy things!

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,170
It's what I normally feed her.

42
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,090
Yummy things are really yummy!
