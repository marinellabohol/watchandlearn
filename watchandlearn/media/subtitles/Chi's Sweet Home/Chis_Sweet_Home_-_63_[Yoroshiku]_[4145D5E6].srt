00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,040
Well, nice, nice.

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,000
Huh?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,220
Now that Mom's well.

5
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,220
Our house is totally back to normal.

6
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,900
Youhei, we have to leave soon.

7
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,380
Okay.

8
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,770
I'm going.

9
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,320
I'm going.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,950
Yeah. Take care.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,030
So now...

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:53,900
Chi.

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,280
What?

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,170
I haven't played with you for a while, so...

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,580
There, there, there.

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,550
There, there.

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,120
There.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,700
Let's play a lot today.

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,380
It's a game!

20
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,100
Wait, wait!

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,240
Wait, wait!

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,240
There, there.

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,920
Yay.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,630
There, there.

25
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,710
There, there.

26
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,170
Wait!

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,760
Are you enjoying this?

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,780
There!

29
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,460
Oh! Something is wrong.

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,640
I feel dizzy.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,210
Is it...

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,390
fever?

33
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,630
I have a fever.

34
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,990
Dad, let's play some more.

35
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,620
Sorry, Chi.

36
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,270
What?

37
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,750
Although I was confident about my health.

38
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,380
Oh!

39
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,630
This isn't a toy.

40
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,850
What's this?

41
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,970
Chi!

42
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,890
Now, now.

43
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,600
Yay!

44
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,230
Gotcha!

45
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,620
Chi, give it back to me.

46
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,440
Oh!

47
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,050
It's a tug of war.

48
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,670
Tug, tug!

49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,970
Chi, I have a fever.

50
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,240
Give it back to me.

51
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,240
This is fun!

52
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,170
Please.

53
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,920
Dad, you win.

54
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,930
I have a bad feeling.

55
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,390
What are we going to play with next?
