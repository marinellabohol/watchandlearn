00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,630
This is bad.

3
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,010
And the deadline was yesterday...

4
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,110
Arg!

5
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,390
This is completely hopeless!

6
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,240
I can't come up with anything!

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,710
Is Dad trying to catch up again?

8
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,420
Hmm?

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,040
Yeah.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,110
It seems he's busy with work.

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,040
Umm...

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,210
Gra... Gra...

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,280
Graphic designer.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,400
I'll read a picture book to you today, so be quiet, okay?

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,490
Okay!

16
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,150
Dad, let's play!

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,220
Hey! Hey!

18
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,970
I'm going to the toilet.

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,060
Dad, this is cool!

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,280
It must be nice to be carefree like a cat...

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,570
You're not playing?

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,350
Huh?

23
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,130
What's that up there?

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,970
There's loads of stuff!

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,780
This is fun!

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,160
This is fun!

27
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,550
There's lots of things to play with.

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,180
H-Hey, Chi!

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,140
You can't do that!

30
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,080
No! I want to play more!

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,670
I want to play more!

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,740
Ah... It's done this much...

33
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,370
Even though I bought toys for Chi to play with...

34
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,810
Why my work tools?

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,150
This is...

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,850
That's it!

37
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,660
If I use "sky" as the motif...

38
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,220
It will work!

39
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,240
I can visualize the idea!

40
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,470
...and they all stayed together.

41
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,760
You did very well, Chi!

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,470
Amazing!

43
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,300
They all lived happily ever after.

44
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,620
Now then, let's do this!

45
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,760
I wonder if Dad is playing with Chi.

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,130
Who knows?

47
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,590
There are lots of things to play with in Dad's room!

48
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,700
All right, let's do our best, Chi!

49
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,650
Oh...

50
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,130
That looks fun.
