00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,070
Umm...

3
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,250
Are the cups cleared away?

4
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,010
I wonder if I locked up properly so that she can't get out.

5
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,520
What are you doing, everyone?

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,990
Oh yes!

7
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,920
I have to check there.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,810
What? What?

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,310
Kitty litter, okay.

10
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,810
Mom.

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,140
What should I do?

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,520
Well...

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,790
You can put away the toys, okay?

14
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,020
Okay!

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,630
Chi!

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,060
Thank you, Chi.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,570
Huh?

18
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,300
You're not playing?

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,640
Prey!

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,140
This is fun!

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,140
Now, now, Chi.

22
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,650
Chi, you shouldn't intrude.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,650
Chi, I'm putting things away so you won't get tangled up while you're in the house alone.

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,860
All right.

25
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,910
With this, preparations are complete.

26
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,910
Boring...

27
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,970
Oops!

28
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,920
I forgot Chi's dinner.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,040
I can eat this much?!

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,010
Let's eat!

31
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,510
Chi is house-sitting, so I've given her a bit more than usual.

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,480
Hey.

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,120
If we're going out, now's the time.

34
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,980
I see.

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,020
Yummy!

36
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,490
Well then, off we go!

37
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,490
Going out!

38
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,600
But will Chi be okay house-sitting on her own?

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,170
She'll be fine.

40
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right.

41
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,220
It's not like Chi will get lonely when she's all alone.

42
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,010
I'm not worried at...

43
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,650
Chi!

44
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,660
Dad!

45
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,010
Goodness me.

46
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,140
You were the one who said we should let her house-sit, right, Dad?

47
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,900
Eh? Ah... Is that so?

48
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,020
That's right!

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,780
But Chi will be...

50
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,630
That's not an excuse.

51
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,520
Let's go.

52
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,190
I'm stuffed!
