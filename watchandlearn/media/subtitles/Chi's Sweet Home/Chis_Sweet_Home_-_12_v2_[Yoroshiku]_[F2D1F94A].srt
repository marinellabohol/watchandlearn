00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,060
I wonder if Youhei will be lonely?

3
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,260
Yeah, it's understandable.

4
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,930
He's been playing happily with Chi.

5
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,870
Let's play?

6
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,510
Hey, let's play!

7
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,420
He's not playing.

8
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,710
Chi seems lonely too.

9
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,820
Maybe it realizes something?

10
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,190
Let's play!

11
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,910
Hey, let's play!

12
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,290
Chi, you'll be going away, huh?

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:06,790
What?

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,770
No! No!

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,830
I don't like being squeezed!

16
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,120
Let go of me!

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,120
Chi...

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,190
Ow!

19
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,050
She'll be mad at me!

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,440
Huh?

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,420
She isn't getting mad.

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,010
Chi...

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,300
But, there's no helping it, is there?

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,360
Dogs and cats are prohibited here...

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,410
Chi will be able to live more comfortably somewhere else.

26
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,300
Yeah.

27
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,320
I'm sure Chi will be happier that way.

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,800
What's the matter?

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,070
What? What?

30
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,080
Huh?

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,810
Hello, Yamada residence.

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,570
Ah, yes.

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,300
No, thank you too.

34
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,710
Umm, about that...

35
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,660
I'm sorry!

36
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,700
Eh?

37
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,880
My husband brought a kitten home from work today.

38
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,390
Eh?

39
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,310
It was from his superior, so there was no way he could turn it down.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,550
Then, what about Chi?

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,310
What?

42
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm truly sorry.

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,690
We can't take Chi-chan in anymore.

44
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,550
Really?!

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,590
Don't worry about it!

46
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,200
Please, don't worry about it!

47
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
What? What's going on?

48
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,330
Okay, well then, good night.

49
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,080
Dad!

50
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,580
Yeah, let's keep it here.

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,910
Hey, is that about Chi?

52
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,630
Chi can stay here?

53
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,180
That's right.

54
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,550
Yeah. Chi will become our kitty.

55
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,330
I feel like this is fate now.

56
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,430
It's actually something we shouldn't do, but...

57
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,970
Chi.

58
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,140
No! No!

59
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,810
Chi!

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,860
Let's play?
