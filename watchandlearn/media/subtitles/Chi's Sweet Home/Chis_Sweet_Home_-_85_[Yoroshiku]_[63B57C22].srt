00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,300
Huh? A notice?

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,760
Yes.

4
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,650
A while ago, the landlady posted a notice that said, "Inform me if you see a cat."

5
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,340
We're in trouble.

6
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,930
Anyway, we have to be more careful, so Chi won't be discovered.

7
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,140
Right.

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,580
It'll cause trouble if we let her go outside and get captured.

9
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,820
Right.

10
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,790
A stroll.

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,980
We have to be careful when we leave via the front door.

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,520
And windows too.

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,700
We mustn't leave the windows open.

14
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,430
Chi!

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,170
Wait!

16
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,020
Youhei, catch her!

17
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,470
Huh?

18
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,430
Let me go!

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,440
That was close.

20
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,440
We left the screen door open while
discussing keeping the windows shut.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,530
I'm going outside to play!

22
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,080
I wonder when we left it open.

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,030
I think I closed it after I went out to hang the laundry up to dry.

24
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,210
I closed it too.

25
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,250
That's weird.

26
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,290
I wonder how it got open.

27
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,250
Chi.

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,530
So she opened it herself.

29
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,300
She's clever.

30
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,960
Yes, she is.

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,870
So, she wants to go out again.

32
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,030
Wait!

33
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,580
No, I'm going!

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,370
It's amazing that she opened the screen door by herself.

35
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,940
I assume she can't open the glass door,

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,960
but if that's closed, we won't get any fresh air.

37
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,760
Huh?

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,760
Chi, you can't go out whenever you want.

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,910
We're safe with this now.

40
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,810
I suppose so.

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,460
It doesn't open.

42
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,000
Why?
