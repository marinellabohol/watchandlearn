00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,300
The next station is my home.

3
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,250
My home.

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,290
My home?

5
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,490
That's a nice station.

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:42,810
Hmm?

7
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,430
Departing!

8
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,430
What's that?

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,310
That's weird!

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,000
That's weird!

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,260
Trying to catch the moon...

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,820
That's it!

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,800
Youhei has so many toys, yet Chi has none...

14
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,700
Huh?

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,360
It disappeared.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,820
Where did it run away to?

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,350
I'm going out for a while.

18
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,960
Eh?

19
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,280
A business meeting?

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,050
Nope. Just a bit of shopping.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,490
Oh...

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,790
Have a safe trip.

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,460
Umm, excuse me.

24
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,580
Yes?

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,870
Ah! The customer from before.

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,540
Ah, hi.

27
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,940
Where are cat toys?

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,860
Oh my, this time it's kitty toys?

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,120
Here! Right this way!

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,300
This way!

31
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,640
Over here we have a wide range of popular toys for all kinds of cats, from kittens to calm adults.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,540
The ever-popular floundering fish!

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,180
The unmistakably pleasing fluttering hamster!

34
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,500
The ringing cat ball will fascinate them as they chase it!

35
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,800
The ribbon-tail will make them frolic mindlessly!

36
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,260
Your cat will chase caterpillar Poyonsuke at full speed!

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,110
We have lots of others too.

38
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,340
What were you looking for today?

39
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,400
Umm...

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,030
This one and... this one and...

41
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,090
Look Chi, toys!

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,300
Are you having fun, Chi?

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,650
I'm glad.

44
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,310
Sir?

45
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,970
Sir?

46
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,640
Sir?

47
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,640
Oh, yes?

48
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,750
Which would you like?

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,840
Umm...

50
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,340
A-All of them, please.

51
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,470
Okay!

52
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,220
Thank you very much!

53
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,690
Chi, there's a fun time ahead of you!
