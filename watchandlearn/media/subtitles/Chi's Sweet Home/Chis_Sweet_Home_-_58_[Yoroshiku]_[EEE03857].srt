It's a frog.

3
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,350
It's a jumpie.

4
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,940
It's flowing.

5
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,940
Isn't this fun, Youhei?

6
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,950
Oh!

7
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,030
Huh?

8
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,880
Oh my!

9
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,660
I left one.

10
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,290
My dump truck will blow away!

11
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,670
What?

12
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,100
Eh?!

13
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,110
Oh my,

14
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,260
the rain is getting heavy.

15
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,900
Right.

16
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,170
Help me!

17
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,370
No!

18
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,340
Youhei, what are you making?

19
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
Is it a teruterubouzu?

20
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,090
Note: A prayer doll for good weather.

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,340
Yeah.

22
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,090
So that the weather will be fine tomorrow.

23
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,860
I hate getting wet!
