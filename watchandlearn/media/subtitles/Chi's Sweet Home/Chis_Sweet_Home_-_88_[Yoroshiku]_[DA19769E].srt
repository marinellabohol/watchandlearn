00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,050
So are you telling me to give Chi away?

3
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,550
I didn't say that.

4
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,080
Because that bear cat has been causing trouble, the landlady came here.

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,060
Chi hasn't been seen yet.

6
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,890
But...

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,110
Hey, hey. Do you want to play?

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,100
Chi.

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,380
That's distracting.

10
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,110
Chi, what are you doing?

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,640
What do you want to play with?

12
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,760
Hey, I think we can only hide Chi for so long.

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,330
Then, are we going to find a new owner?

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,040
Chatting?

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,550
Because we may be forced to move away from here.

16
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,830
I want to play!

17
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,700
But Chi is already part of our family.

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,180
What do you want to play with?

19
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,120
That's why I asked you, "What should we do?"

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,370
But what can we do?

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,170
Do you wanna play with me?

22
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,260
Do you wanna play with me?

23
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,190
Hey, hey.

24
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,720
We've gotten out of sync.

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,790
Yeah.

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,040
Youhei.

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,260
Would you take care of Chi?

28
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,210
In the end, what do you want to do?

29
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,920
What do you want to do?

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,670
Oi!

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,220
Oi!

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,320
This is hide and seek!

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,770
What are you doing, Chi?

34
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,270
Peek-A-

35
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,530
Boo!

36
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,720
She's distracting us so much that we can't talk.

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,340
We're talking about her anyway.

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,540
Anyway, Chi hasn't been found yet.

39
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Let's think about this calmly.

41
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,880
Yeah.

42
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,550
About what we should do from now on.

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,300
Boo!

44
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,680
Peek-A-

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,050
Boo!

46
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,550
Peek-A-

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,980
Chi, I can't read my book.

48
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,680
Boo!
