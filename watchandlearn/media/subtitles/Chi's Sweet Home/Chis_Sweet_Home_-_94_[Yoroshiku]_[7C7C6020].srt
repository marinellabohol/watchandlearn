00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,010
Chi?

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,710
Chi?

4
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,990
She's not here.

5
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,140
What should I do...

6
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,960
if the landlady finds her or something?

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,440
What will happen if she's found?

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,310
I wonder what will happen...

9
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,570
Who are you?

10
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,530
C-Catch it!

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,530
O-Okay!

12
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,100
Run!

13
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,540
Do you want some?

14
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,910
I caught it.

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,620
There!

16
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,940
Parent and child?

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,450
And here I thought there was just one.

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,630
I see there are two rampaging around.

19
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,630
What are you doing?!

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,610
We're running! Follow me!

21
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,270
Okay!

22
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,390
They got away!

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,440
Wait!

24
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,140
Where in the world did Chi go?

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,350
Ah! Chi!

26
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,900
Huh?

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,410
The black bear cat...

28
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,570
Chi!

29
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,140
Huh?

30
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,750
Wait!

31
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,290
Hey!

32
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,290
L-Landlady?!

33
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,210
Wait! Hey! Cats! Wait!

34
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,340
Hey!

35
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,800
Wait!

36
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,770
What will happen if Chi gets caught?

37
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,810
I wonder what will happen...

38
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,110
We're climbing.

39
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,080
Huh?

40
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,920
I can't take it. I can't climb!

41
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm going home!

42
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,220
That's impossible now.

43
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,910
Follow me!

44
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,730
Why? I don't wanna!

45
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,000
My instincts are telling me to run.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,630
In-stink-s?

47
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,170
Chi doesn't know in-stinks.

48
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,140
I've never met him!

49
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,020
It's an important thing.

50
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,520
Run!

51
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,100
What, what?!
