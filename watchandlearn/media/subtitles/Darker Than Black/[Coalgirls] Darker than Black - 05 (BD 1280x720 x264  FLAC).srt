2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,390
Are you alone?

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,420
I always keep my promises

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,200
since I'm a businessman.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,810
That's a good attitude, Mr. Smith.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,840
I'd like to start discussing the deal now.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,930
Is that okay with you?

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,620
Before we begin,

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,130
please refrain from smoking in my presence.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,520
Second-hand smoke contains a higher amount of toxic substances than direct smoke.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:43,460
The amount of the carcinogen dimethylnitrosamine present in direct smoke is between 5.3 and 43 nanograms,

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,150
while there are between 680 and 823 nanograms in second-hand smoke.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,010
As a matter of fact, the amount of quinoline from second-hand smoke is eleven times greater than direct smoke.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,050
A staggering eighteen thousand nanograms.

15
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:02,040
In other words, the health risk of people exposed to second-hand smoke is greater than those who actually smoke.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,030
Hold your breath, then.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's pretend we never met.

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,330
Wait.

19
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,210
Hey!

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,400
Sit down.

21
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,360
This is only a down payment.

22
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,620
Once I've confirmed its authenticity, I'll pay double.

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,740
What are you going to do with it once it's in your hands?

24
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,630
I'll start by killing off about three thousand employees from our rival company.

25
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,600
I'm kidding.

26
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,970
I'll resell it.

27
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,250
Bastard, don't screw around with us...

28
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,390
Is it really that valuable?

29
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,400
Of course.

30
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,650
The deal is off.

31
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,840
Why?

32
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,030
If the boss says the deal is off, the deal is off.

33
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,660
I suppose it can't be helped.

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,430
Get out.

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,560
My arm...

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,710
Boss...

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,380
Hey, get a hold of yourself.

38
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,750
Don't tell me you're a...

39
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,500
contractor...

40
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,420
Stay away! Stay away!

41
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,970
Monster!

42
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,960
Hey, my feet... I can't move my feet!

43
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,250
Don't come any closer!

44
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,670
Stay away, monster!

45
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,660
Its location.

46
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,250
I'll talk... I'll talk, so don't kill me!

47
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,550
2220 Pier Drive... it's there!

48
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,480
That's a good attitude.

49
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,330
Your remuneration is anything but impressive, as always.

50
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,880
Shall we get going?

51
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,170
You're Havoc, correct?

52
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,960
You'll be accompanying us for the next several months.

53
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,630
From your right: April,

54
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,010
July,

55
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,220
and myself, November 11.

56
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,470
We're from MI6.

57
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,170
Tokyo International Airport

58
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,460
She goes by the alias of Havoc.

59
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,300
She was feared by people as the most diabolical contractor in history.

60
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,410
It was said that the number of lives she claimed during the Third South American War, also known as Heaven's War,

61
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,920
was anywhere between several hundred and several thousand.

62
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,050
She has the ability to create a vacuum at any location,

63
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,680
but the details are unknown.

64
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,870
Her ability has not been confirmed as of five years ago.

65
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,190
She is currently considered a regressor, as indicated by a spectrum analysis of her star.

66
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,860
Regressor, huh?

67
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,360
You don't hear much about them.

68
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,540
Cases like that aren't only rare.

69
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:54,080
Once their activities become untraceable, the subject is usually removed from further investigation.

70
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,560
And moved into research, right?

71
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,810
Exactly.

72
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,000
What else?

73
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:06,610
It was reported that the subject admitted to being partially involved with the CIA during the MI6 interrogation.

74
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,930
The CIA has bluntly denied those allegations, of course.

75
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,150
I am Eric Nishijima from Pandora.

76
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,900
I'm here to ask you several questions.

77
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,450
When you disembarked from the airplane, did you experience any physical abnormalities?

78
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,790
No, I didn't.

79
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,960
How about mentally?

80
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,020
Nothing.

81
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,420
From this point forward, you will cooperate with Pandora, the U.N.-led research institute,

82
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,370
in conducting various experiments within Hell's Gate.

83
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,090
Do you have any problems regarding this arrangement?

84
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,810
You're the ones who have a problem with it.

85
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,670
The downfall of a contractor, perhaps?

86
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,820
Five years ago, after the disappearance of Heaven's Gate in South America,

87
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,180
how did she wander about and arrive in Romania?

88
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,960
Um, excuse me, but...

89
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,180
Oh, pardon me.

90
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,400
I am Jack Simon of the British Foreign Ministry.

91
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,310
I've been informed about you,

92
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,520
Mister...

93
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,100
Please call me Jack, Misaki.

94
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,940
My name is Kirihara.

95
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,580
Episode Five Red Giant over Eastern Europe... (Part One)

96
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,440
Is this your first time in Tokyo?

97
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,440
No, I've been here twice before on assassination missions.

98
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,740
I'm kidding.

99
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,930
Mr. Simon, I also have something I'd like to ask you.

100
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,000
Ask away.

101
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:32,030
Upon capturing a valuable subject such as Havoc, why didn't the MI6

102
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:37,700
conduct research of their own, instead of deferring her to the U.N.-led Pandora?

103
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,300
Isn't it the same in Japan?

104
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,830
Although new international laws were established after the war,

105
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:50,010
I can't believe nations have given up on researching supernatural beings and the gate.

106
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,800
Japan included.

107
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,710
Yes.

108
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,430
In the U.K., there is very little public support for research on supernatural beings,

109
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:01,110
especially after the impasse that occurred in South America.

110
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,310
In order to avoid risk and efficiently obtain information,

111
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,110
we have concluded that it is in our best interests to follow standard procedures.

112
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:18,630
I did advise them to have her killed off for her own sake or have her return to her life as a prostitute, though.

113
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,950
It's me.

114
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,890
What's up?

115
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,070
Yeah.

116
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,440
Yes?

117
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,290
Kouno?

118
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:44,920
Boss, it seems like there's an organization trying to approach the helicopter transporting Havoc.

119
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,260
How do you know that?

120
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,790
They're talking about it in the back of the car.

121
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,950
My, my.

122
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:01,180
We transferred it to Pandora to prevent it from becoming proprietary property, yet the CIA...

123
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,250
It doesn't matter. Kill them.

124
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,470
I'll have Inspector Kirihara take care of the paperwork.

125
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,730
I'm going to stop the car.

126
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,010
Kouno, Matsumoto-san, confirm the current situation.

127
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,100
Saitou, contact the division manager.

128
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,540
Tell him to issue a warning to the CIA through diplomatic routes.

129
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,620
Now!

130
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,200
I want an explanation.

131
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:35,170
Explanation? The CIA came to retrieve her at the very last moment,

132
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,400
unaware that they fell for our bluff.

133
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,340
Bluff?

134
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,270
Yes, she's in there.

135
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,680
It can't be!

136
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,720
How cruel.

137
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,350
That aside, since when...

138
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,460
It's not that I don't trust you.

139
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,110
I just wanted to know how much information would be leaked.

140
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,600
My sincere apologies.

141
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,750
Where are we passing by now?

142
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,170
Rest assured, we're heading toward Pandora headquarters.

143
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,540
What's wrong?

144
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,230
That is... a person just...

145
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,140
There isn't anyone around here.

146
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,780
I'm sure there was...

147
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,410
It's me.

148
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,250
It's here.

149
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,700
H-Hey...

150
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,880
Mr. Simon...

151
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,240
We're still in the middle of a convoy.

152
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,150
Apparently we fell into a trap.

153
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,970
Trap?

154
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,860
It's here.

155
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,600
Boss!

156
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,490
That's the person who ran by the car.

157
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,120
That's...

158
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,120
The black Grim Reaper.

159
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,380
What's the matter?

160
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,350
Boss, they're contractors!

161
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,170
Headquarters! Headquarters, do you read me?

162
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,630
Call for assistance immediately!

163
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,390
I'm terribly sorry.

164
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:16,470
Focus on retrieving the abducted Havoc for the time being.

165
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,440
Yes, sir.

166
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,750
Do you think you can resolve the issue that easily?

167
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,830
I didn't expect the additional information would be leaked as well.

168
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,210
Japanese police have no administrative control over confidential information,

169
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,440
just as November 11 said.

170
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,010
November 11?

171
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,940
Jack Simon's code name, the diplomat who accompanied you.

172
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,790
Then he's the...

173
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,540
The top agent from MI6.

174
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:52,090
In any case, as stated in Pandora Law, Article 22,

175
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:57,160
you are to retrieve Havoc according to our instructions from this point forward.

176
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,470
Is that clear?

177
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,880
Yes.

178
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,100
Public Safety Division
Foreign Affairs Department 4

179
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,910
I don't care if he's a triple A agent. He was outsmarted as well.

180
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,110
He's not that great.

181
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:14,590
Isn't there a possibility that they let her be abducted?

182
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,380
Why would they do that?

183
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,620
If I knew why, I wouldn't be asking!

184
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,500
Boss, a notice from the Division of Astronomy just came in.

185
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:30,480
Activity from BK201 was detected at the time you were attacked.

186
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,030
BK201...

187
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,190
Contractors sure have a troublesome life.

188
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,950
They have to smoke tobacco and drink liquor against their will.

189
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,730
I like alcohol though.

190
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,500
Did you know everything was going to turn out like this,

191
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,090
November 11?

192
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,590
If I had known, I would have taken all precautionary measures.

193
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,970
However, my measures were insufficient.

194
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,960
In other words, the answer is no.

195
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,190
However, from this incident, one thing's for sure.

196
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:37,100
No diplomatic route can dissuade the organization that abducted Havoc.

197
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,550
In other words...

198
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,660
The enemy isn't the CIA.

199
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,230
Shinjuku Torino Theater.

200
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,490
Parking available.

201
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,250
Shinjuku Torino Theater.

202
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,460
Parking available.

203
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,760
Well...

204
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,090
Next time, it'll be our turn to hunt him down...

205
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,170
Mr. 201BK.

206
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,700
She's calm.

207
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,790
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.

208
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,760
Got it.

209
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,730
We'll deliver her to the syndicate tomorrow morning.

210
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,470
It seems that they want to keep Havoc away from the gate at any cost.

211
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,220
Even I don't want to keep a monster like that around for too long.

212
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,370
Monster, huh?

213
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,240
Hey, where the hell is Havoc?

214
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,660
I don't see Hei either.

215
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,220
Yin, where are they?

216
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,950
They left.

217
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,310
Left?

218
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,950
Where?

219
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,670
I don't know.

220
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,860
Who would have thought you'd still be alive,

221
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,840
Carmine?

222
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,210
It's been a while since someone called me by that name.

223
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,110
What happened during that time?

224
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,410
Where's my sister?

225
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,710
Where's Pai?

226
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,310
You call out your sister's name.

227
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,610
It drifts into the air and disappears into the crimson sky.

228
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,490
A regressor,

229
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,670
deprived of power in exchange for momentary peace and a fragment of hope.

230
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,970
However, sins take their toll and deny everything.

231
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,650
The cold blade cuts proof that the corpse from that day once lived,

232
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,350
and the gates of hell have been knocked on.

233
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,340
