2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,800
You're late.

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,180
Who are you?

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,330
It's always raining.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,880
What a miserable country.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,750
Are you the one who called me out here?

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,970
You already know why you deserve this.

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,160
Well, just give up.

9
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,510
What an unpleasant season.

10
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,360
Damp and stagnant.

11
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,830
Well, it sure fits the image of this grimy town.

12
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,660
My name is Kurasawa Gai,

13
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,910
private investigator.

14
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,740
I've been making a living by observing the damp, stagnant nature of people.

15
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,880
I don't trust anyone.

16
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,970
My only love is tobacco.

17
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,350
It stinks!

18
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,460
What do you mean by "funyuu",

19
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,520
you flat-chested girl?

20
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,110
I don't believe it.

21
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,270
Those kinds of insensitive remarks could be considered sexual harassment.

22
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,180
This is the worst!

23
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,160
The stench of tobacco, athlete's foot medication,

24
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,250
and something else mixed in for good measure...

25
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,050
Yeah, the smell of my armpits.

26
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,230
Drop dead!

27
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,670
Hey, this isn't the time to be slacking off.

28
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,040
The TV station came to collect the subscription fee yesterday.

29
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,470
They'll really block the feed these days.

30
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,860
You can still see network stations.

31
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,700
I can't miss Bara no Maurice!

32
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,460
An anime?

33
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,430
Why are you watching anime at work in the first place?

34
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,570
Wasn't that part of the conditions we agreed upon?

35
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,610
I wouldn't be working in a dump like this if it wasn't for that.

36
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,290
Hey, you...

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,750
Excuse me.

38
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,270
It's a woman,

39
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,900
and a beauty at that.

40
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,680
How do you know?

41
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,080
Investigator's intuition.

42
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,280
How many times have you gotten in trouble because of that intuition?

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,930
Don't be deceived, boss.

44
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,120
I don't care if I'm deceived.

45
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,980
No, more than that...

46
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,140
I want to be deceived.

47
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,150
So this is a genuine request?

48
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,630
Um, what else would it be?

49
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,640
Well, debt collectors, for example...

50
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,560
Nothing!

51
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,910
A search for a missing cat, though?

52
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,130
Yes. My husband Yuzuki and I loved her as if she was our own child.

53
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,530
If Mii-chan were gone, it would cause Yuzuki grief.

54
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,320
So you haven't told your husband yet?

55
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

56
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,180
My husband passed away quite some time ago.

57
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,540
Oh, I'm sorry about your loss.

58
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,810
Although I understand your feelings and the circumstances...

59
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,580
If it was only a search for a missing person

60
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,920
instead of a cat.

61
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,140
It was disrespectful of me

62
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,790
to ask a private detective about something of this nature.

63
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,150
No, it's not that.

64
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,820
Maybe a dog, but a cat is somewhat out of my hands.

65
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,100
How about five hundred thousand yen?

66
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,550
I'll pay half in advance.

67
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,060
You don't have to return the money, even if she isn't found.

68
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,890
No, that's not the issue...

69
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,890
We'll find Mii-chan!

70
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,900
You... Who said I'd...

71
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,790
Leave it to the Kurasawa Detective Agency!

72
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,780
Here you go!

73
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,820
Thanks.

74
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,600
Competitive eating contest or something? Unbelievable.

75
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,620
Yeah. I can't believe

76
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,970
you don't like cats.

77
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,410
First of all, you're not in a position to be picky.

78
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,360
Huh? "Former cosmetics employee falls to his death"?

79
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,760
Something like this happened the other day.

80
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,780
"The police are still investigating on the premise of a suicide."

81
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,920
We have to make a missing cat poster, you know.

82
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,370
We need to distribute fliers and trick local kids into looking for it.

83
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,090
There are tons of things to do.

84
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,740
It's the same company, as I thought.

85
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,100
Isn't it suspicious?

86
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,940
Were you listening to me?

87
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,830
Consecutive suicides, you know.

88
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,330
They were both former employees of Fiore Cosmetics.

89
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,190
Fiore Cosmetics?

90
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,920
What's the matter?

91
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,860
Oh, I just remembered!

92
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,450
That perfume... It's the really expensive one from Fiore!

93
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,410
The widow who was looking for the cat.

94
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,250
You could smell it a mile away.

95
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,980
I sure remember that scent.

96
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,770
No, I mean...

97
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,800
More importantly, there are things we need to do, right?

98
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,810
Thanks for the meal.

99
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,510
Thanks, as always.

100
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,320
Hey, did you get a look at that guy?

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,870
Are you talking about that glutton?

102
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,290
He'll definitely get fat after he turns thirty.

103
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,590
He's hot! He's cool!

104
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,300
Especially around the collar bones.

105
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,780
Is it tasty, Hernandez?

106
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,470
Rika, where did you go?

107
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,910
I'm busy. Where the hell are you?

108
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,380
Bye, Hernandez!

109
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,770
Oh, thanks again!

110
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,210
Is it any good?

111
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,590
Well, I can't let good intentions go to waste.

112
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,030
What did you want to talk to me about, Hernandez?

113
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,540
This one is pretty close,

114
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,840
but the nose is different!

115
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,040
The nose isn't black.

116
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,550
Sorry, but here's a reward for you!

117
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,420
Onee-chan's cosplay picture!

118
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,430
Here. Thanks, nyan.

119
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,930
I don't want this!

120
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,770
Hey, where were you while I was diligently looking for the cat?

121
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,290
That's a job for women and children.

122
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,810
Those kinds of discriminative remarks aren't politically correct these days!

123
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,880
I bet you're just afraid of cats.

124
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,400
I found out about something interesting.

125
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,240
That widow's deceased husband was an executive of Fiore Cosmetics.

126
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,270
So?

127
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,240
The consecutive suicides were committed by former employees of the same cosmetic company.

128
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,840
Don't you think the pieces are starting to fit?

129
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,360
Not at all.

130
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,820
You're an idiot, Kiko.

131
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:41,620
Discovering clues from subtle connections is part of what being a detective is all about.

132
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,250
A man's job.

133
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,810
Hi, boys and girls! Can you show your cats to Onee-chan, nya?

134
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,500
Yes!

135
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,520
Episode Seven The Scent of Gardenias Lingers in the Summer Rain... (Part One)

136
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,400
A gardenia, huh?

137
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,620
Who is it?

138
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,650
It's Kurasawa.

139
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,170
Um, I have an appointment with the madam...

140
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,420
today, and...

141
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,420
Please come in.

142
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,440
It looks more like a grandfather and his granddaughter.

143
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,030
I bet you overexerted yourself.

144
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,140
Does it smell?

145
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,870
I apologize for making you wait.

146
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,500
N-No, it's...

147
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,760
You have a wonderful collection.

148
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,340
Oh, the perfume?

149
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,470
It was Yuzuki's hobby.

150
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,600
Oh, your late husband, Yuzuki Sakutarou-san.

151
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,480
I heard he was an executive of Fiore Cosmetics,

152
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,480
who started his career as a perfumer.

153
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,360
Is that why...

154
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,330
He was sensitive to fragrances.

155
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,620
As expected of a detective,

156
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,650
you've deducted nearly everything.

157
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,320
No, this was nothing...

158
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,140
My, how surprising, Chanel-chan,

159
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,120
for you to sit on the lap of a stranger.

160
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,840
Chanel-chan...

161
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,880
You like cats, don't you?

162
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,460
Yes, I do...

163
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,270
I pissed my pants a bit.

164
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,080
Oh, excuse me.

165
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,020
I made a wrong turn.

166
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,390
Huh? You're...

167
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,050
A part-time worker?

168
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,690
Yes, to sort the bookshelf.

169
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,770
Is he an acquaintance of yours?

170
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,480
No, it's nothing like that.

171
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,020
What about Mii-chan?

172
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,860
I'm sorry. She hasn't been found yet.

173
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,220
I see.

174
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,100
To tell you the truth, madam...

175
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,570
I mean... There are several things I'd like to inquire about.

176
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,200
That's right.

177
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,300
Perhaps... it was Toshiko's doing.

178
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,720
No, it probably was Toshiko!

179
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,290
T-Toshiko?

180
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,090
You already knew I was his second wife, didn't you?

181
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,380
Well, yes.

182
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,420
Have you also heard the story about how I took Yuzuki away from his first wife?

183
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,010
Well, yes.

184
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,390
It's all right. Those rumors were bound to be exposed.

185
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,910
I wonder who was the one who actually took anything away, though.

186
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,680
A huge amount of consolation money, the mansion,

187
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,320
and Mii-chan, to top it off.

188
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,490
Hold it right there.

189
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,270
Are you saying that his ex-wife took the cat?

190
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,320
It must be!

191
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,700
Mr. Detective, conduct a search of Toshiko's mansion.

192
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,200
Huh?

193
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,580
She's an anti-social person who lives alone in that mansion.

194
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,680
I hear she's frequently away.

195
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,950
That is...

196
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,530
Mr. Detective, please...

197
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,950
But...

198
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,630
Mr. Detective?

199
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,720
Yes?

200
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,220
You have some wax in your ear.

201
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,800
You mustn't.

202
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,650
Hold still and don't move.

203
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,410
Madam! Madam!

204
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,160
My, what waxy ears you have!

205
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,370
Sorry for making you do this for me.

206
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,130
It's okay. I'm doing it because I want to.

207
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,280
Amazing!

208
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,620
I've never experienced such wonderful ear cleaning!

209
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,050
You're exaggerating. It's been a hobby of mine for a long time.

210
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,640
Speaking of which, do you know what they say?

211
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,230
People with waxy ears have strong body odor.

212
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,140
Isn't that an old wives' tale?

213
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,330
Is that so? How about yourself, Mr. Detective?

214
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,150
Hey, wait...

215
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,720
G-Give me a break...

216
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,960
As I thought! I have waxy ears, too.

217
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,270
Yuzuki wasn't pleased with that,

218
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,030
which is why I started wearing stronger perfume.

219
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,540
Does that bother you?

220
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,870
No, of course not.

221
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,290
But this scent...

222
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,550
is like a gardenia, isn't it?

223
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,520
Yuzuki told me it fit the present season.

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,850
To be honest, I never liked strong perfume.

225
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,360
I guess I was completely persuaded by Yuzuki.

226
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,630
Oh, sorry about earlier.

227
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,490
I heard you work part-time at the mansion.

228
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,760
This is my business card.

229
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,240
I saw you earlier at a ramen shop in the neighborhood.

230
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,970
That's why I asked about you.

231
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,300
Sorry about that.

232
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,710
A coincidence?

233
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,880
No, I don't think so.

234
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,300
A man working part-time as if he was waiting for an opportunity like this.

235
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,480
A beautiful widow.

236
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,880
A suspicious maid.

237
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,630
There's definitely something going on in that mansion.

238
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,600
Are you getting on?

239
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,380
Huh?

240
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,800
Are you going to get on?

241
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,630
Yes, I am.

242
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,770
Why are you suddenly interested?

243
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,940
It's work, after all.

244
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,700
It's a crime to sneak into other people's homes.

245
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,320
Don't make it sound like an appalling thing.

246
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,290
I'm just going to look for a cat while the tenant is out.

247
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,360
That's definitely a crime!

248
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,120
Well, I don't really care.

249
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,630
For your information, I'm on paid vacation starting tomorrow.

250
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,250
I already told you I had an important event to attend at Aoto tomorrow.

251
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,780
Are you saying that I'll have to look for the cat by myself?

252
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,470
Of course I am.

253
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,460
It's work, after all.

254
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,390
Is he around here?

255
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:56,010
Yin was only able to track him up to here.

256
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,790
Over there?

257
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,080
Is that the remuneration for your contract?

258
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,710
A cat?

259
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,580
A homicide disguised as a suicide, huh?

260
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,180
What an elaborate plan.

261
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,220
Hei!

262
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,040
Why did you interfere?

263
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,020
Be grateful.

264
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,280
He was about to possess you.

265
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,550
Possess?

266
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,390
Your body, that is.

267
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,010
He has the same ability as me.

268
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,330
The possession of other people.

269
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,510
Although I can only do it to animals,

270
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,580
he can move from person to person.

271
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,880
Geez, why does the weather have to be so hot when the sun's out, for once?

272
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
Thank you for waiting.

273
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,080
Toshiko-chan's not home, huh?

274
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,180
I don't know whether that's a good thing or not.

275
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,270
Sir?

276
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,080
Huh?

277
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,550
Your order, please.

278
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,310
Oh, I mean...

279
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

280
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,860
Excuse me.

281
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,310
Forgot something... Forgot something...

282
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,230
Forgot something...

283
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,230
Forgot something... Forgot something, see?

284
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,710
Scary guy.

285
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,740
It's him. What's he doing here?

286
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,040
What?

287
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,620
Mao, we have company.

288
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,720
Don't lose sight of the contractor.

289
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,260
Mao, do you read me?

290
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,520
Mao?

291
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,300
Why was that guy here?

292
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,270
Does he know about the connection between the widow and the ex-wife?

293
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,920
Regardless of everything, Toshiko-chan's house sure is huge.

294
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,390
What is this smell?

295
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,240
Hey, you!

296
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,580
Oh, I'm not a suspicious person.

297
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,540
Nice shot!

298
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,400
Huh?

299
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,140
Do you know the person who lives over there?

300
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,470
No.

301
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,130
You don't?

302
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,860
That house is causing problems.

303
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,090
Problems?

304
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,890
It's that, the garbage mansion.

305
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,900
I've been complaining to the ward office,

306
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,180
but they aren't handling it properly.

307
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,560
Garbage mansion?

308
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,560
Fore!

309
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,140
That'll be four hundred and twenty yen.

310
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,440
This isn't my jacket.

311
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,070
Don't tell me...

312
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,570
This looks pretty bad.

313
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,910
How careless.

314
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,760
What is this?

315
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,790
Geez, why are things like this?

316
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,880
There it is!

317
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,990
Damn! Outsmarted by a stupid cat.

318
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,710
I did it.

319
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,460
Literally written as "the rain in May" in kanji, its meaning is "early summer rain".

320
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,820
The cold rain seeps into my heart.

321
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,070
The sweet fragrance of the gardenia tickles my nostrils.

322
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,410
Widow... The sweet sound of the word.

323
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,450
Oh, why must you be a widow?

324
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,800
Every time I recall your superb ear-cleaning skills, my heart goes...

325
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,920
Get a hold of yourself, boss.

326
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,330
If you're seduced by that woman's pheromones,

327
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,640
she's going to take everything you have, right down to the hairs on your ass.

328
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,660
Even a girl like you shouldn't say something like that out loud!

329
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,330
Episode Eight The Scent of Gardenias Lingers in the Summer Rain... (Part Two)
