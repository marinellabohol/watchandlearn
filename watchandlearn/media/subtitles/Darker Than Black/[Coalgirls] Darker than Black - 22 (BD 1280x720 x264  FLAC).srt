00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,100
It's common knowledge that contractors act rationally

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,490
regardless of what kind of situation they're in.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,670
They are able to remain calm and collected while devising a sensible solution.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,460
Are you awake, kitty cat?

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,820
Is it because they know no fear?

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,130
No, contractors can get scared shitless, just like anyone else.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,830
The only difference is that they don't act on their emotions.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,060
Even in a situation where they've been taken to the enemy's hideout...

10
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,480
Where do you think you're going, kitty cat?

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,070
I'm a contractor and a cat, for one reason or another.

12
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,410
However, I can still make a rational assessment of my situation.

13
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,820
I'm at the mercy of the enemy.

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,280
This is the best idea I can come up with.

15
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,650
Does it still hurt?

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,850
Thanks. I'm all right now.

17
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,780
Those lunatics from PANDORA are screwing around with us!

18
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,990
They should have known that nothing would come out of searching you, boss.

19
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,410
It's surprising that the Cabinet Office ordered the dispatch of PANDORA.

20
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:39,120
It's probably because it would have become a diplomatic issue if the Japanese police went too far.

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,510
What a damn shame.

22
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,110
You're right. They didn't have to yield investigation jurisdiction to PANDORA.

23
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,790
We're in Japan, for crying out loud.

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,540
External Affairs, Section Four.

25
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,350
Yes. Boss!

26
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,610
The manager wants to see you.

27
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,460
It's Kirihara.

28
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,610
Come in.

29
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,570
I'm sure you're already familiar with the agents.

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,570
Hi.

31
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,620
I believe we haven't met.

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,180
This gentleman is in charge of MI6's operations in the Far East.

33
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,380
The name is Decade.

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,980
I'm Kirihara.

35
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,030
I asked you to come here because of...

36
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,260
November 11.

37
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:25,890
What?

38
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,060
I'll get straight to the point.

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,640
Do you know where he is?

40
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,650
With all due respect, I'd like to ask you the same question.

41
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,180
In other words...

42
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,700
Wasn't he ordered to disappear from the scene?

43
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,740
I had assumed it was related to the abduction of Dr. Schroeder.

44
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,830
I haven't heard a word from him in a week.

45
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,130
What do you mean?

46
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,510
That's what we'd like to know.

47
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:09,100
Is he still MI6's best agent or has he become an instrument of the terrorists?

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,960
You look younger every time I see you, February.

49
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,700
Excuse me, I should have said Amber.

50
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,400
You haven't changed at all, November 11.

51
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,610
I don't see the man from the other day.

52
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,140
Amagiri? That's too bad. Did you take a liking to him?

53
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,240
No, I don't have those kinds of interests.

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,530
That's good to know. Since we're short on time, let's move on to the main topic.

55
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,820
Ask me whatever you'd like.

56
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,970
Anything at all? What's your favorite kind of food?

57
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,790
Apples.

58
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,920
What a coincidence. Me, too.

59
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,270
You're lying.

60
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,730
That makes two of us.

61
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,740
Let's get back on topic.

62
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,970
Be my guest.

63
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,980
There's only one question I'd like to ask.

64
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,900
What's the truth behind the syndicate you betrayed?

65
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,710
Hold on. In order for you to get a better idea about the situation,

66
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,390
I've invited somebody else.

67
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,570
Please come in.

68
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,940
Dr. Schroeder...

69
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,010
Who are you? One of them?

70
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,760
He might be, depending on what you have to say.

71
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,910
I told you, I'm just a scientist employed by PANDORA.

72
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,270
What you people refer to as the syndicate...

73
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,810
Tell him the entire story, including that.

74
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,700
How many normals are in this room?

75
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,550
In other words, how many people here aren't contractors?

76
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,090
Everybody here is a contractor.

77
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,680
My only ally is this cat, isn't it?

78
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,250
He's a contractor, too.

79
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,150
Will you keep the promise we made earlier?

80
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,020
You won't kill me, no matter what I say?

81
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,470
You have my word.

82
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,470
My experimental hypothesis is very simple.

83
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,060
If I'm correct, every contractor will disappear from this planet.

84
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,650
What?

85
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,330
Is that it?

86
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,690
Yes.

87
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,980
Is Mao still alive?

88
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,910
He was fine while the apparition was present.

89
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,550
What are Amber's objectives?

90
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,080
Last time she abducted Yin, and now she's taken Mao.

91
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,480
That's not all. The good-looking guy from MI6 is involved, too.

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,380
Yin, what did Amber talk about the other day?

93
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,470
About you, Hei.

94
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,430
About your past and your future.

95
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,070
Hey, wait!

96
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,740
Don't tell me you're going there by yourself.

97
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,030
There's no guarantee you'll make it back alive, even for somebody like you.

98
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,350
You'll have to give up on Mao.

99
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,280
He'd say the same thing if he was in my shoes.

100
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,100
Amber's after me.

101
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,010
I don't want to drag anyone else into this.

102
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,910
Aren't you going to look for him?

103
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,270
Would you like one?

104
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,180
There's no point in worrying about him.

105
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,390
There's no way that man would leave a trail.

106
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,360
By the way, why are you cooperating with us?

107
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,580
Orders from above, or is it...

108
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,230
I just want to know the reason.

109
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,660
Reason?

110
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,670
Why did he say that to me?

111
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,570
"From here on out, the line that separates enemies from allies doesn't exist."

112
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,420
"You must act on your own intuition."

113
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:22,450
Dr. Schroeder already obtained the solution to the formula referenced in the plan.

114
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,440
The Third Sector's research team has reached the same conclusion as well.

115
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,190
In other words, we no longer need Dr. Schroeder.

116
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,700
We now have a replacement for the meteor fragment.

117
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,740
What a ridiculous plan!

118
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,140
Unfortunately, it isn't very ridiculous at all,

119
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,330
although it failed in South America.

120
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,080
Were you responsible for the disappearance of Heaven's Gate?

121
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,480
Well, we weren't the ones who made it disappear.

122
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,840
Technically speaking, it didn't really disappear, either.

123
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,160
There was a strange emission of light moments before we proceeded with the plan,

124
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,920
and immediately after that happened, a 1,500 kilometer radius of Heaven's Gate in South America

125
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,980
became a physically unapproachable, neutral territory.

126
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,280
Lancernoptic reactions, beta-Garching waves from the area,

127
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,720
and the presence of a similar existence known as Hell's Gate

128
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,180
are grounds for the hypothesis that Heaven's Gate still exists to this day.

129
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,370
However, it's out of our hands.

130
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:32,050
Then again, the fact that the plan went awry during that time, despite the accuracy of my calculations,

131
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,450
means that something significant probably occurred.

132
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,380
Wouldn't you agree?

133
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,500
Are you trying to recreate that occurrence in Tokyo as well?

134
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,890
If we don't, we'll definitely disappear.

135
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,550
You make it sound as if you've seen the future.

136
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,390
Yes, I have.

137
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,410
I find that hard to believe.

138
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,780
I'll prove it to you.

139
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,240
How would you do that?

140
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,740
You'll die shortly after you leave this building.

141
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,220
Hey, what do you think? How's he going to die?

142
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,890
We've literally received a death sentence, too.

143
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,230
That man's no different from us.

144
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,300
That would be a problem. I'm in the middle of an experiment.

145
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,060
If Amber's plan works, it'll be a huge blessing for contractors.

146
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,160
Hey, don't you have any friends who'll come to your rescue?

147
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,050
Contractors are rational beings.

148
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,260
They aren't stupid enough to engage in a fight at the cost of their life.

149
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,470
I wouldn't, anyway.

150
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,720
The Black Grim Reaper has made his way inside.

151
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,090
What should we do?

152
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,190
Nobody has to die here.

153
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,720
What about the professor?

154
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,700
The syndicate doesn't need him anymore.

155
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:22,950
Got it?

156
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,630
Episode Twenty-Two City Under Crackdown, Moist with Tears... (Part Two)

157
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,660
Sorry for making you go out of your way for our sake.

158
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,510
It's not a problem.

159
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,310
November... I found him.

160
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,900
Where is he?

161
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,660
What? What?

162
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,470
Yin?

163
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,330
It couldn't be.

164
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,540
Hei!

165
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,940
Amber!

166
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,500
Let us settle our differences while we have an opportunity to do so.

167
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,960
You can't do that.

168
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Your job is to keep him busy.

169
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,920
Hei, behind you!

170
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,330
What are you trying to do?

171
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,990
What else are you going to take away from me?

172
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,750
Ask your feline friend about the details.

173
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,670
I told him everything.

174
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,620
T-This is...

175
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,010
Hei!

176
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,350
Onii-chan.

177
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,730
It looks like we aren't meant to be the protagonists of this story, no matter how it unfolds.

178
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,860
I'll leave the rest to you, kitty cat.

179
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,630
Freeze!

180
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,910
Lie on your stomach, and slowly place your hands on the floor.

181
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,360
Now!

182
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,810
Dr. Schroeder!

183
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,310
Dr. Schroeder, are you all right?

184
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,280
Dr. Schroeder!

185
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,290
I had a quick check done, and there aren't any traces of the professor's memory being altered.

186
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,070
His vitals are normal.

187
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,470
I see.

188
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,080
What the hell happened?

189
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,610
I don't know.

190
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,230
Manager...

191
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,580
Good work.

192
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,080
Professor.

193
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,760
Now I know why South America became like that!

194
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,140
It was because of the masked contractor's powers!

195
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,920
Let's resume the testing right away! If they beat us to it...

196
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,880
Professor,

197
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,860
the tests are already being conducted.

198
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,620
What are you doing?

199
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,320
Please escort the professor back to PANDORA.

200
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,670
We still have questions we need to ask the professor.

201
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,830
So do we.

202
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,600
Good day.

203
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,150
Manager!

204
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,780
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about it.

205
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,840
I see. The professor told them everything.

206
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:46,020
As you said, it would be dangerous to defer the plan until the next solar maximum.

207
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,810
I know.

208
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,890
That man has been taken care of.

209
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,310
So long.

210
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,780
Where have you been all this time?

211
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,830
I was finishing my mission.

212
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,930
What is that?

213
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,750
A report on the so-called syndicate.

214
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:20,600
You were afraid that I'd uncover your secrets, weren't you?

215
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,090
I was more afraid of losing my best agent.

216
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,890
Of all people, I didn't want you to find out.

217
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,550
Not until the very last moment of your kind's existence.

218
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,860
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

219
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,360
Me, too.

220
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,680
Please record your message within fifteen seconds after the beep.

221
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,780
It's me. I thought I wouldn't bother you with a farewell message, but...

222
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,730
It looks like I've put you two in a life-threatening situation.

223
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,420
Let me emphasize that this isn't a jo...

224
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,530
I guess I don't have to complete my remuneration since I'm going to die.

225
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,970
Why?

226
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,850
Why did he do something like this?

227
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,670
Why?

228
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,060
"You shouldn't get involved any further."

229
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,870
That's why he sacrificed himself without telling you.

230
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,370
A rational decision, befitting of a contractor.

231
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,970
I appreciate your concern.

232
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,890
Thanks, Misaki.

233
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,180
I've finally gathered the necessary amount of dolls.

234
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,150
I see.

235
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,960
We can't turn back the hands of time anymore.

236
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,600
Good-bye.

237
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,670
Why did you rescue me?

238
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,000
The most sensible course of action was to...

239
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,170
leave you to die.

240
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:08,930
It doesn't take the rational mindset of a contractor to understand something as simple as that.

241
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,100
You're a bunch of idiots.

242
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,440
He's the only idiot among us.

243
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,190
That aside, what was the urgent matter?

244
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,240
Oh, the GQ model from MI6 died.

245
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Are you serious, Huang?

246
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,090
Yeah, he took his boss and their associates with him.

247
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,570
Knowing how the syndicate works,

248
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,590
it's only a matter of time before they find out Mao was there.

249
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,780
You need to tell me everything before they do.

250
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,580
What exactly happened over there?

251
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,550
That man... He knew he was going to die.

252
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,230
It looks like there's a reason why I survived.

253
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,790
I heard it from Amber.

254
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,650
The syndicate's trying to erase every single contractor from the face of the Earth.

255
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,560
What?

256
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,530
Amber and her allies are establishing a resistance.

257
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,310
That's why they concealed the gate in South America five years ago.

258
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,960
Hold on. What the hell are you talking about?

259
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,750
Wrong!

260
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,670
Her actions can't be justified!

261
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,390
She's only... only...

262
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,880
She's not that kind of person.

263
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,480
What the hell is going on?

264
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,260
Two people, wandering the city with nowhere to go,

265
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,390
meet each other where the man died.

266
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,390
The two of them walk together.

267
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,070
They do not mention the doubts they have in their hearts,

268
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:59,990
and time simply passes, along with the faint twilight of feelings.

269
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:05,260
The countdown to the end had begun, before they even realized it.

270
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,360
Episode Twenty-Three God is In His Heaven...

271
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,540
And then, she says goodbye.
