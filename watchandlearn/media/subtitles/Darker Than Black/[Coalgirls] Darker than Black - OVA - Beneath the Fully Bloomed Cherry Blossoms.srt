2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,480
At that moment, the wind had suddenly blown.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,980
Among the scattering cherry blossom petals in full bloom,

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,640
the young masked man murmured something to the cat nestling at his feet.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,160
Amazingly, the cat had talked as if it was a natural thing to do.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,170
Ah, amazing, the plot's developing!

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,610
And then, and then?

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,930
And then, the masked man fluttered like...

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,620
Hey, you're killing the mood!

10
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,130
Give me a break!

11
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,850
Why the heck is everyone mating?

12
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,860
This is why I hate spring.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,680
I am Ootsuka Mayu.

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,490
I am a member of the 4th Foreign Affairs Department in the Police.

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,200
Just between us, I was in the manga club in my university,

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,740
and I'm actually pretty into it.

17
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,660
The anime I'm into now, is...

18
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,550
Maurice The Rose.

19
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,330
My hobby is writing stories.

20
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,990
Of course, I have done many doujins, and I have a lot of fans as well.

21
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,800
The pollen this year is terrible.

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,610
This is why I hate spring.

23
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,620
"The masked man standing among the cherry blossom trees."

24
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,310
This image came to mind from a dream I had last night.

25
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,580
No, was it really a dream?

26
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,360
Even now, it's still a bit vague.

27
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,910
The members of the 4th unit had decided to hold a flower-watching party that night.

28
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,010
What's this?

29
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,010
It's information that the contractor who was killed was holding onto the other day.

30
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,640
It looks like the number for a safety deposit box and we've found out where it is, but...

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,520
The critical number is missing.

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,150
The stolen goods from the incident at the Gate.

33
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,900
I believe it is related.

34
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,930
Under a cherry blossom tree?

35
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,820
Yeah, it seems a contractor who had taken some goods from the Gate was buried there.

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,680
So, I have to kill that contractor?

37
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,690
No, your job is only to dig up the goods.

38
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,330
What's buried is only a sample, but

39
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,350
there should be a numeric password written on a memo or something.

40
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,930
Don't forget about it.

41
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,950
Is that it?

42
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,310
Don't let your guard down.

43
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,560
I have a feeling that someone may try to steal it ba-

44
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,900
You okay?

45
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,030
Shut up.

46
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,950
Allergic to pollen?

47
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,500
During times like this, I'm happy that I'm a cat.

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,130
I hear cats are allergic to pollen, too.

49
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,980
Really?

50
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,510
Don't worry, Mao.

51
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,470
Pollen won't affect us.

52
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,170
What?

53
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,220
Contractors don't see dreams and aren't allergic to pollen.

54
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,200
That's the first time I heard that.

55
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,140
In the end, contractors are monsters.

56
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,050
There's nothing strange no matter what it may be.

57
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,540
Is it true?

58
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,770
Oh yeah, where's Yin?

59
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,730
That pink girl must've have come again.

60
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,690
Pink girl?

61
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,450
From the first time they met when Yin ran away, she's been going there ever since.

62
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,320
Here.

63
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,190
Wasn't it great?

64
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,740
Yeah.

65
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,140
I'll tell you about an interesting doujin story next time, okay?

66
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,050
It's even more risqué!

67
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,640
What's it called? Moe moe?

68
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,120
It seems that she's become involved with a dangerous world now.

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,990
Tell her to cut her ties.

70
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,590
It'll be problematic if she lets out information to a normal person.

71
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,030
Here you go, Matsumoto.

72
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,140
Ah, thank you.

73
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,940
Saitou seems a bit gloomy.

74
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,990
It's because the chief couldn't make it.

75
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,950
He's probably dreaming of being alone with her after watching the flowers if things go well.

76
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,070
He should just tell her.

77
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,490
The chief is pretty dense about things like that.

78
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,640
Well, he has to think about their positions, too.

79
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,460
It doesn't seem like spring will be coming for him.

80
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,760
But there are also people like you who bow down to their colleagues.

81
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,460
W-What silly things are you saying, Matsumoto?!

82
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,620
H-Here, another one.

83
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,050
I've had enough.

84
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,220
Be careful, Ootsuka, he just might be the one who's thinking about what'll happen if things go well.

85
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,260
I'll be all right, I don't really like young people.

86
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,480
A refined person like you, Matsumoto, is more...

87
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,840
Just kidding.

88
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,240
To be truthful...

89
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,600
I wasn't really interested in real men...

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,090
Until that time.

91
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,090
Like I said!

92
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,600
You've got to be more forward!

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,460
Kouno just disappeared somewhere after some office lady seduced him!

94
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,750
Geez, she's a bad drunk.

95
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,530
If you like her, you should tell her clearly!

96
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,900
Geez, you just don't understand a woman's heart!

97
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,030
You should research and read some novels!

98
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,700
Novels? Those things?

99
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,180
What do you mean, those things?

100
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,190
You'll understand when you write stories, too!

101
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,100
Like how delicate people's hearts are!

102
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,250
Oh? You write some?

103
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:30,010
Ah, oh no, Matsumoto, you're making me embarrassed.

104
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,340
If you search for MayuMayu on the computer, you can read my stories right away!

105
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,800
Eh, are you interested?

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,330
I may not look like it, but I was once a young man who was into literature.

107
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,830
I've read quite a bit, like works from Kamizaki and Kajii.

108
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,000
Wow, you really are refined, Matsumoto!

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,030
Ah, I guess...

110
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,260
Beneath the cherry blossom tree lies a buried corpse.

111
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,570
Or some mystery like that.

112
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,100
Let's begin.

113
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,600
A buried corpse, huh?

114
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,590
Ah, I shouldn't have asked something that weird.

115
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,620
Why do I, feared as the Black Reaper, have to do this?

116
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,120
This is it?

117
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,570
What about the numerical password? Is there a memo or something?

118
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,540
No.

119
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,130
This is it, it's written right on it.

120
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,970
4697...

121
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,530
W-What was that?

122
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,710
A-A pervert!

123
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,870
S-S-Stay away!

124
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,660
This is the number.

125
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,130
4697635.

126
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,680
You heard the number just now, didn't you?

127
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,090
I-I heard nothing.

128
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,000
The number 4697635!

129
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,930
You heard it again!

130
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,390
N-No, it's because you said it!

131
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,410
Shut up!

132
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,190
Dammit! I can't keep things a secret because of my remuneration!

133
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,520
Remuneration?

134
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,910
I said something I shouldn't have again!

135
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,520
I can't let you go now because you heard things you shouldn't have.

136
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,040
I-I don't remember any numbers.

137
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,280
Liar! 4697...

138
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
635.

139
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,870
See? You do remember.

140
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,040
T-That's because you said it over and over!

141
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,370
S-Stop!

142
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,670
Things seemed so detached from reality just now,

143
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,890
and all I could remember was the appearance of the person who saved me.

144
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,460
He was beautiful.

145
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,020
Especially the line of his collarbone.

146
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,360
I remembered that he had danced like the air, though.

147
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,490
And there my memory stops.

148
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,980
You got her?

149
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,660
Tell the ones on top to erase her memory.

150
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,760
What is it?

151
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,240
Public Safety Department?

152
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,880
Which means she knows that contractors exist.

153
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,530
In that case, if we use the ME, it won't mean we've cleared out every trace.

154
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:05,480
If she's part of Public Safety, then at the very least, she won't be stupid and reveal information about us to the public.

155
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,060
And if she does?

156
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,150
If that happens, there's only one thing to do.

157
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,650
Take the goods to Huang, Mao.

158
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,040
I'll take care of the rest.

159
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,240
I got it.

160
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,730
A dream?

161
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,830
So it was...

162
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,160
That's all I could believe it was.

163
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,700
But for some reason, my pulsing heart just wouldn't stop.

164
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,590
And then...

165
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,220
A story began to flow from me.

166
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,410
It was like a drunken spring dream.

167
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,940
The cat had told the masked man the mysterious password.

168
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,790
Number, huh?

169
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,790
What would work?

170
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,290
And for some reason, this number from my dream was burned onto my mind.

171
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,610
Episode Twenty-Six Beneath Cherry Blossoms in Full Bloom...

172
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,250
You lost the goods?

173
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,120
Don't give me that crap!

174
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,290
Sorry, unexpected things happened.

175
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,580
Cats have it tough during this season.

176
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,680
I desperately looked for it, but...

177
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,880
Don't worry, I'll find it for sure.

178
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,610
You better! Damn it, everyone's so...

179
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,410
By the way, don't get too close to that girl, Yin.

180
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,620
You know what situation you're in, right?

181
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,370
Huang, she's made a friend, so a little bit...

182
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,240
Stay out of this!

183
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,580
You got it?

184
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,170
Yes.

185
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,410
There it is!

186
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,790
Hey!

187
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,060
It's mine! I've been looking for this for 2 years!

188
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,500
The Maurice pilot is super rare!

189
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,100
What are you saying? This Maurice has been waiting for me!

190
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,750
A book can't possibly wait for you!

191
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,680
Your head's gone crazy!

192
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,700
What's crazy is your head!

193
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,130
Are you serious?

194
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,700
Are you really the MayuMayu who wrote "Maurice's Night?"

195
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,880
Yeah.

196
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,500
I can't believe I called such a great person a brute and a swine.

197
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,620
If there were a hole, I'd like to crawl into it right now.

198
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,840
It's all right, you just need to be careful from now on.

199
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,900
Oh yeah, that story you uploaded yesterday about the masked man was cool!

200
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,850
Eh? You read it already?

201
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,700
It's an original character, right?

202
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,100
How is he going to get involved with Maurice?

203
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,770
Well, you'll just have to wait.

204
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,330
It'll be unfair to other fans.

205
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,100
I see...

206
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,370
But the masked man with delicious collarbones is really great!

207
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,800
I know someone like that, too.

208
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,930
Eh? A masked man?

209
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,140
No, someone with nice collarbones.

210
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,430
Thanks for the meal.

211
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,260
Come again!

212
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,970
Those collarbones...!

213
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,840
See? They're delicious, aren't they?

214
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,480
No doubt...

215
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,410
There's no doubt!

216
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,010
W-What's wrong?

217
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,310
Ah, no, it's nothing.

218
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,250
Those are the collarbones that saved me.

219
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,260
No doubt about it.

220
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,420
It wasn't a dream!

221
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,260
It wasn't a dream!

222
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,320
A-Are you okay?

223
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,530
Please tell me where he lives!

224
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,780
No! I'm the only one allowed to stalk him!

225
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,180
I've been in a slump these days.

226
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,810
Isn't that really bad?

227
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:59,310
I'm sure I'd be able to write something interesting if I met him.

228
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,360
Umitsuki Apartments

229
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,840
On that night, my legs had finally made their way to the Umitsuki Apartment.

230
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,010
My desire to meet him had overcome me.

231
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,950
What am I doing?

232
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,070
Ootsuka.

233
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,980
Ootsuka!

234
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,120
Y-Yes!

235
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,980
Are you so busy that you're losing sleep?

236
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,360
N-No!

237
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,810
Just what do I...

238
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,660
Could it be...

239
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,430
These feelings...

240
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,670
Why is she looking for us?

241
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,150
Could it be that she knows who we are?

242
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,140
You still can't find it?

243
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,240
Yeah.

244
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,400
What the hell are you doing?

245
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,660
Can't you at least remember the password?

246
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,920
I do remember some of it.

247
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,500
4697...

248
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,760
4697635.

249
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,790
What did you just say, Yin?

250
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,940
4697635.

251
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,330
The password.

252
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,690
Jun, who had received the password from the masked man,

253
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,890
ran full speed to the zoo where Maurice was being kept.

254
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,780
And then he yelled,

255
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,310
"Maurice, I need you after all."

256
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,130
Yin, w-what are you saying?

257
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,940
Even humans and elephants can love each other.

258
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,160
It may be forbidden love,

259
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,910
but Maurice, I will live my life with that love.

260
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,200
"Maurice's Night," this is it!

261
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
What's this?

262
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,570
Are you saying this number is the complete password?

263
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,580
I just let Kouno go and confir—

264
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,770
Bingo! It certainly is the right number.

265
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,590
But, someone else got here already.

266
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,630
We were too late!

267
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,870
Why is that number here, though?

268
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,470
I don't know, but I heard that it's a story she had written.

269
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,300
Story?

270
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,120
So you've read it, Matsumoto?

271
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,390
Yeah...

272
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,690
The masked man is also written here.

273
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,850
If it's about BK-201...

274
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,960
Ootsuka said that she didn't see him, though.

275
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,610
Which means she got information from another source.

276
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,840
It'll be dangerous if she makes any bad moves.

277
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,740
That's right, we've got the goods, but the information has been leaked.

278
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,330
They've got you tailed, too.

279
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,330
You know what to do, right?

280
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah.

281
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,300
There it is!

282
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,970
All right!

283
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,130
You lost her?

284
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,140
What the heck are you doing?

285
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,750
You're...

286
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,750
Ootsuka! Get in!

287
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,440
Why are you here, chief?

288
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,420
He's a contractor? Do you want to get killed?

289
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,910
Contractor? But he's the one who save—

290
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,760
Just hurry up!

291
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,050
Chief!

292
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,770
Idiot! Come on!

293
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,510
What's going on?

294
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,510
It's BK-201, the Black Reaper.

295
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,100
BK-201?

296
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,740
You looked for him not knowing that?

297
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,690
If I had known, I wouldn't have written the story.

298
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,840
You should know he's suspicious because of his mask, at least!

299
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,760
I don't know.

300
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,340
Love is blind!

301
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,970
Love?

302
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:20,090
That's right, Saitou worries about his position,

303
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,750
and can't ever confess his love. That just isn't love!

304
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,900
What are you saying?

305
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,190
Get down!

306
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,670
Let's call for reinforcements!

307
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,620
They won't make it, take Ootsuka and run, Saitou!

308
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,940
I'll hold him back!

309
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,770
Please don't be ridiculous!

310
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,060
I can't abandon someone I lov—

311
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,610
It's love! That's all to it.

312
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,250
Saitou!

313
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,390
Saitou!

314
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,060
Li-kun?

315
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,780
Hei!

316
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,620
I found it, Hei!

317
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,690
W-What just happened?

318
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,890
Strangely, no one remembers what happened that night.

319
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,230
But it seems like it wasn't just me who didn't feel clear about it,

320
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,600
the same feeling as if something is stuck in your throat.

321
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,770
Don't you remember, chief?

322
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,960
I'm sure I remember saying something really important to you that night.

323
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,270
Sorry, I can't remember.

324
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,780
Anyway, I feel that I found the truth regarding something very important.

325
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,520
However, only one thing was clear.

326
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,260
Ever since then, my allergies have been healed for some reason.

327
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,980
I don't know why, but I feel like I will have a nice spring.

328
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,920
Medicine for allergies?

329
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,860
Yeah, seems like it was made by the chemical department from the Gate.

330
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,270
If everything went well, it could've led to a complete cure.

331
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,630
So that's what that fluid was?

332
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,090
Yeah, but there's a negative side effect.

333
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,610
You lose a few days' worth of memory.

334
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,150
It's unfortunate, but it'll be a while before it's put to use.

335
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,550
Wait, Huang, Hei and I haven't lost our memories of that time.

336
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:03,410
Is it because of what Hei said then? That contractors aren't allergic to pollen.

337
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,010
Who knows? I don't know about contractors.

338
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,960
Oh, it's the pink girl.

339
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,810
She's probably heading to Yin's place.

340
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,170
Hey, Huang.

341
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:18,720
We were able to collect the goods thanks to Yin remembering the number.

342
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,570
Yeah, do whatever you want.

343
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,830
Aren't you glad, Yin?

344
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,990
Yeah.

345
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,080
It can't be... right?

346
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,170
She's not coming today?
