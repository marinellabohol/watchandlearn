2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,060
You're late, even though you're the one who called us out.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,480
I've received orders from above.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,240
We're to assassinate the guru again.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,070
Understood.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,440
There's more. About the fate of the woman who was captured...

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,080
Is she to be disposed of?

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,360
We can't afford to fail this time.

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,080
I'll go.

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,320
Tomorrow. Sixteen hundred hours at the usual place.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,580
Yeah, that isn't like him.

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,820
Hold it, Hei.

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,350
To tell you the truth, I've received orders as well.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,350
Orders?

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,980
To be precise, you and I have received orders.

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,540
If Huang cannot kill the captive,

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,610
we're to kill him.

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,270
The west side is completely open.

19
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,440
Got it. Your cue will be when the alarm starts to sound.

20
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,620
Hey!

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,230
What's with that expression? Did they inject truth serum into you?

22
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,420
You better not have forgotten who I am.

23
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,190
Have they already noticed?

24
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,650
Where's the guru?

25
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,620
Tell us where she is!

26
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,650
The guru isn't here.

27
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,090
On a slope two hundred meters north of here lies a deserted village.

28
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,510
She's in one of those houses.

29
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,800
It'll be hard to miss since she'll be surrounded by guards.

30
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,430
It's me.

31
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,560
The guru's tired. Make it short.

32
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,940
I know. I just came to confirm whether she'll secure more dolls.

33
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,970
Let's go. We're going to act as decoys until Hei reaches the guru.

34
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,320
This way.

35
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,270
It's you.

36
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,070
If you retreat without saying a word, I won't go after you.

37
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,280
If you came to kill Arma, I won't be able to turn a blind eye.

38
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,450
They're pretty tough for a religious cult.

39
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,620
Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to kill you without Amber's permission.

40
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,660
She wants to recruit you as a member.

41
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,690
Quite an honor.

42
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,270
Why don't you accompany me without making a scene?

43
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,280
I refuse.

44
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,330
Come in. I know you're out there.

45
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,850
It isn't a trap. Come in.

46
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,200
Aren't you going to go after him?

47
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,270
Forget about it.

48
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,590
Isn't he after the guru?

49
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,810
Transporting the dolls is our top priority.

50
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,810
I'll find another route to secure the rest.

51
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,300
Did the negotiations with the guru fall apart?

52
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,340
Fall apart? She's useless.

53
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,910
She no longer serves any purpose.

54
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,420
Two more... What a troublesome remuneration.

55
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,350
My cholesterol level is going up.

56
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,190
You're a frightening woman.

57
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,810
You sent a chill down my spine a moment ago.

58
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,170
It reminded me of that night.

59
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,450
You became close to me, as planned,

60
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,270
in order to acquire information that Isozaki and I had found.

61
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,250
What are you going to do?

62
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,990
What do you mean by that?

63
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,680
Are you willing to let this relationship drag on?

64
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,130
I don't mind.

65
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,450
It's not like I have any relatives who would bug me about it.

66
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,260
What are you trying to say? Were you thinking about tying the knot?

67
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,930
I-Idiot.

68
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,770
I thought so. You're not the type of person who'd do something like that.

69
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,480
It's not an issue about what kind of person I am.

70
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,460
I get it. You're worried about a conflict of interests.

71
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,380
It isn't like that!

72
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,470
You know... I don't have a very good-looking face or anything,

73
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,090
and I'm barely home when I'm after a suspect.

74
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,850
It's fine.

75
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,040
If you're okay with me, Kiyopii,

76
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,650
I'd be... really happy.

77
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,110
Idiot.

78
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,510
Are you all right?

79
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,960
This is the first time I've seen you drunk, Kiyopii.

80
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,950
No, I'm not drunk.

81
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,300
Hey! Be careful!

82
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,980
I'm always careful. Come on, sit down.

83
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,360
It looks like I don't have a choice.

84
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,230
Did I make you happy enough to get drunk?

85
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,460
Idiot. I'm not saying this because I'm drunk,

86
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,000
even though I am.

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,400
Which is it?

88
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,990
Hey, stay with me.

89
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,090
Don't betray me.

90
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,380
Kiyopii.

91
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,090
I want to ask you something.

92
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,250
I wondered why you would ask me about the photo Isozaki and I saw.

93
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,060
I can't recall anything that happened after that,

94
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,990
but it looks like I told you everything.

95
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,520
You disappeared from my sight a few days after that incident.

96
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,930
Why did you kill Isozaki?

97
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,570
Isozaki's wife had her memory erased by the government.

98
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,280
All of her memories about Isozaki vanished.

99
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,600
Do you understand? Isozaki was erased twice.

100
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,130
Once from this world, and once from the memories of the woman he loved.

101
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,220
It's all your fault.

102
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,720
The man called Isozaki hid his actual identity from you.

103
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,430
What?

104
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,140
The group of illegal aliens you were going after

105
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,710
consisted of the cult's founding members.

106
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,480
Isozaki was secretly connected to them.

107
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,990
What did you say?

108
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,340
The photo you found that day

109
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,260
was of Arma's actual appearance.

110
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,800
Come inside.

111
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,750
You're the contractor from that night.

112
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,510
Isozaki was determined to destroy the evidence.

113
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,780
He pretended to report it to his superiors, but he actually hid the photo.

114
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,040
That's ridiculous!

115
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:00,460
At that time, it was unknown whether it was you or Isozaki who was the spy for the cult.

116
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,390
That's why...

117
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,810
Is that why you approached me?

118
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,970
Is that your true appearance?

119
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,870
Who knows?

120
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,530
To tell you the truth, I don't even know.

121
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,560
My remuneration is aging.

122
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,810
Aging?

123
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,440
Every time I use my ability to transform, I grow older.

124
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,540
It looks like I've run out of time.

125
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,570
Episode Twenty Dreaming Shallow, Uninebriated... (Part Two)

126
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,380
Keep your eyes open.

127
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,110
We'll wait one hour for Hei to return.

128
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,900
What if he doesn't?

129
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,070
I'll go back to the cult grounds

130
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,600
after I kill you.

131
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,390
There's one more thing I have to ask you.

132
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,770
Why weren't my memories erased?

133
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,230
That's because...

134
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,710
What's wrong?

135
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,200
Help... Help me!

136
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,840
What's wrong? Hey, Shihoko!

137
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,390
Shihoko!

138
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,080
N-No!

139
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,480
Why do you let the syndicate exploit you?

140
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,220
I suppose they wouldn't leave you alone, would they?

141
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,440
You could call it the contractor's karma, if you will.

142
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,450
You disregard social and moral standards

143
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,610
and show no remorse for using your abilities,

144
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,700
which enables you to kill people.

145
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,660
It creates a convenient image of a machine meant to kill,

146
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,170
which is a stereotype that humans are comfortable with.

147
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,510
You make it sound as if contractors aren't human.

148
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,020
That's what they want you to think.

149
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:11,020
In order to liberate contractors from this karma, I have chosen religion as my foundation.

150
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,470
In the beginning, it was more like an expedient, a cover of sorts.

151
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,450
However, I still believe I did the right thing.

152
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,260
Do you know what differentiates contractors from humans?

153
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,290
Contractors don't have a soul.

154
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,790
Is that really true?

155
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,410
Contractors have no sense of guilt.

156
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,100
Whether they're committed by contractors or by people,

157
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,000
crimes will never cease to exist.

158
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,710
There's a significant difference between those who possess abilities and those who don't.

159
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,770
Think of that as a bonus.

160
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:58,510
Even if you don't have special abilities, you have the power to take the life of another with a gun or knife.

161
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,270
The most significant difference between humans and contractors is in their mental composition.

162
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,410
In other words, their rational discretion.

163
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,290
In a human society, ideas like compassion and consensus are afterthoughts

164
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,240
to the pursuit of profit, the driving force behind success.

165
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:23,740
Contractors may be the deus ex machina in the race to a profit.

166
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,920
Contractors can't see dreams.

167
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,880
I've seen it.

168
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,360
The ideal relationship between contractors and humans.

169
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,100
Then again, I've used my powers to kill people in the past.

170
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,930
Until that happened, I had second thoughts about using it because of my overwhelming remuneration.

171
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:52,270
However, ever since then, I've decided to use my abilities

172
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,270
just like this.

173
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,680
Repeated use of my powers will result in repeated fulfillment of my remuneration.

174
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,770
I thought I could atone for my actions.

175
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,270
Isn't it strange for a contractor to mention something like atonement?

176
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,700
It looks like the time has come to make my final remuneration.

177
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,700
I'll finally be liberated from this karma.

178
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,510
Isn't it an ironic remuneration?

179
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:40,380
I regain my human conscience for a while.

180
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:47,830
That's why I understand what I'm doing... and how horrifying it is.

181
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,010
It's as if this was my punishment.

182
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,380
Shihoko...

183
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,500
I'm scared.

184
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,240
You're not going to deceive me! I'm sick of this act.

185
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,140
But...

186
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,260
A part of me feels somewhat relieved,

187
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,120
since I normally don't have a sensation of fear.

188
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,010
Contractors have memories,

189
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,630
but it's not quite the same.

190
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,320
It's my own memory, but it feels distant for some reason.

191
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,720
That night was different, though.

192
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,340
That night, when you said you wanted to be with me,

193
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,170
my memories were of...

194
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,660
the chirping of insects, the sound of the flowing river,

195
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,960
the dry, chilly wind of that night,

196
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,640
the shimmering stars.

197
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,100
I forgot to play my role during that moment.

198
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,790
I was simply happy.

199
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,520
It's a happy, yet cruel memory,

200
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:05,870
but it's the only one I have of you.

201
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,590
I was afraid that the memories of our time together would disappear from you as well.

202
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,100
Having your memory erased isn't much different from being killed.

203
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,100
I didn't want to become like that.

204
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,130
So it was you, Shihoko,

205
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,980
who arranged for the preservation of my memory.

206
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,960
Come on. Aren't you done yet?

207
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,070
You seem to be acquainted with that woman.

208
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,270
That's none of your business!

209
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,960
Is she the reason you made that mistake?

210
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,790
I told you that it doesn't concern you!

211
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,040
In that case...

212
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,700
Don't rush me.

213
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,820
What an ugly scene.

214
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,460
Shoot both of us with this.

215
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,700
What are you saying?

216
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,650
Shut up!

217
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,180
You have a compassionate side to you, after all.

218
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,660
I don't want to hear that from a contractor.

219
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,300
Do you realize what you're saying, Huang?

220
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,270
She's a contractor as well.

221
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,990
I do have a soft spot, you know.

222
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,960
Hurry up!

223
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,720
Hei, what are you doing? Don't tell me you're going to let him go!

224
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,640
You're out of your mind!

225
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,250
This isn't the same situation as with the doll from last time.

226
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,230
It's kill or be killed!

227
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,730
Mao.

228
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,010
What are we, the dogs of the syndicate?

229
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,920
Don't think about doing anything stupid!

230
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,390
He's not the same as us.

231
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,400
This isn't about contractors or humans.

232
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,790
How many times have we been saved by him?

233
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,900
Huang, speak with the syndicate.

234
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,880
There's no fear about a leak of information, now that she's been freed.

235
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,930
There's no need to kill...

236
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,090
That's not it.

237
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,590
This is a penalty.

238
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,710
What?

239
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,180
We messed up the first time.

240
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,430
The syndicate knew about my relationship with Shihoko.

241
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,630
They issued the order with that in mind.

242
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,340
In that case, run away.

243
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,500
What?

244
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,960
Take her with you.

245
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,000
D-Don't screw around with me!

246
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
There's no way I could run away!

247
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,920
The syndicate will go after you guys as well!

248
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,390
That's none of your concern.

249
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,410
I-I don't know anything about this. I didn't hear a thing, got it?

250
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,250
There's no way we could escape.

251
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,570
I'm just a contractor.

252
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,660
If I regain my emotions as a contractor...

253
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,480
That's too bad. I've had a long history with contractors.

254
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,060
It's hard to tell the difference between me and them at times.

255
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,610
Let's run away together.

256
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,440
Hei's inside there.

257
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,000
Wait for me there until the arrangements have been made.

258
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,930
What's wrong?

259
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,450
Nothing.

260
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,180
It's a strange feeling.

261
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,650
I'm supposed to have the mindset of a contractor now,

262
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,440
but I feel so... happy.

263
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,880
Is that possible?

264
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,350
Aren't contractors human as well?

265
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,760
You're right. It's possible.

266
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,780
That's all I needed to know.

267
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,770
A boat will arrive in thirty minutes at the far end of the pier.

268
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,960
Let's move.

269
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,480
Kiyopii.

270
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,220
I didn't do it! She jumped in front of the truck!

271
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,650
Shihoko!

272
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,030
Hey, get a hold of yourself!

273
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,830
Kiyo...

274
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,230
Shihoko...

275
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:00,200
She knew that the syndicate had already taken action.

276
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,550
That isn't true, is it, Hei?

277
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,080
Contractors don't think about suicide, do they?

278
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,420
Hey, Shihoko.

279
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,350
Don't betray me.

280
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,580
Kuno-san?

281
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,670
Kuno-san?

282
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,870
What's gotten into you? You were staring into space.

283
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,520
I was just dreaming.

284
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,460
Are you drunk?

285
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,960
I'd like to be, if it was possible.

286
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,170
A conspiracy dwells deep beneath.

287
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,980
A black dragon yearns to wake.

288
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,620
No answers are to be found in the allegations,

289
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,340
and the road to the terminal lies hidden in darkness.

290
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,220
The strings that cross paths are unexpectedly tangled.

291
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,470
Destiny is disturbed and blood spills.

292
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,260
The puppet is controlled, unbeknownst to him,

293
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Episode Twenty-One City Under Crackdown, Moist with Tears... (Part One)

294
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,320
and the man disappears.
