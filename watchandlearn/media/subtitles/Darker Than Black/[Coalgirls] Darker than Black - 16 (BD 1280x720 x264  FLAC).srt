2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:08,470
Happily, painfully... You're shining.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,760
Glittering, shimmering...

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,060
Is she analyzing the Gullfinger wavelength of the stars?

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,340
Hoshimi-sama, who usually doesn't say anything, spoke.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,230
That in itself says volumes about the situation.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:31,330
Indignation, compassion... Where are you going?

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,680
Abnormal behavior exhibited by the astronomer in charge of special duties was also observed five years ago,

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,290
prior to the disappearance of South America.

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:48,050
Various intelligence agencies within the city have also taken the serial bombings into consideration and are at full alert.

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,930
Since these events have occurred before the upcoming solar maximum,

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,020
one could say that the current situation may be the prelude to a tragic scenario.

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,880
As of 5 P.M. today, the Tokyo Metropolitan government has issued special security measures,

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,710
including the implementation of a night curfew, for residents living in certain areas of the city.

15
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:15,100
These measures are to ensure the safety of the city's residents in light of the recent terrorist attacks.

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,580
Areas subject to these...

17
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,460
Your sleeping face is cute.

18
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,800
I've been trying to get Yin to locate Amber, but I lost contact with her.

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,000
When I came here to check things out...

20
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,950
What's wrong?

21
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,790
Amber!

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,460
Hei!

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,490
Hop in. You're in a rush, aren't you?

24
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,850
Hoshimi-sama?

25
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,280
Although a gag order's in effect,

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,350
I wanted you to know, Misaki.

27
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,280
I sent you a list of the stars that were active during the explosions.

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,680
Were contractors involved?

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,610
Wasn't it a series of retaliatory attacks between intelligence agencies?

30
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,230
Information was leaked down to us.

31
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,780
I don't believe that people who make their living in the underworld would resort to such a conspicuous method.

32
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,070
Could it be...

33
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,340
Why did Amber take Yin?

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,130
I heard that you and her were on the same team in South America until she left the syndicate.

35
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,060
What happened between you two?

36
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,920
Stop the car.

37
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,260
You're going the wrong way!

38
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,610
Misaki...

39
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,960
What is it?

40
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,950
November... If anything happens... Police... Misaki's place...

41
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,180
What happened to him?

42
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,250
He didn't come back.

43
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Do you know where he went?

44
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,790
I always know where my partners are.

45
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,690
Tell me along the way.

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,220
Partner?

47
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,770
Nice to meet you.

48
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,630
Good morning. Good afternoon.

49
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,760
Good evening.

50
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,370
Good night.

51
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,900
Thank you.

52
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,700
No need to rush. Take your time.

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,440
It wouldn't be my remuneration if the milk wasn't hot.

54
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,410
Sorry to interrupt your conversation,

55
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,510
but would you mind if I had a cigarette?

56
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,560
They're in my left suit pocket.

57
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,220
I'm not allowed to make physical contact with you.

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,750
You're an excellent contractor.

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,370
You were able to avoid the scorching heat by making a split-second decision.

60
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,440
I'd appreciate a smoke more than a compliment.

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:28,450
Did you know that cigarette smoke is more hazardous to those around the smoker?

62
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:36,310
The amount of the carcinogen dimethylnitrosamine present in direct smoke is between 5.3 and 43 nanograms,

63
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,730
while there are between 680...

64
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,440
I already know that.

65
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:47,270
I've always wanted to see what happens to a contractor who doesn't complete his remuneration.

66
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,860
Do they really melt like butter?

67
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,350
I'm kidding.

68
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,730
There was a vending machine on the street.

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,480
Nice to meet you.

70
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,870
Good morning.

71
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,250
What an admirable young man,

72
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,630
managing to study whenever you're not bombing buildings.

73
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,890
It gives me a strange feeling for some reason.

74
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,820
Amber taught me.

75
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,660
At first, I thought it was pointless.

76
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,770
You can't reach out to people with mere words since they're just enumerations of syllables,

77
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,640
but Amber said that wasn't true.

78
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:38,510
I'm studying every day because Amber told me to.

79
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,630
I'd do anything for Amber's sake.

80
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,400
I'd even destroy this city.

81
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,510
Anything.

82
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,620
You'll have to sit still for a while.

83
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,910
Those were orders from above.

84
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,940
I can't let you meet Amber.

85
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,380
Don't screw around with me!

86
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,360
Hey, Huang!

87
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,300
It's nothing personal.

88
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,020
It's not like I want to do this,

89
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,770
but it's partly your fault for constantly not listening to me.

90
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,650
I'll kill you if you get in my way.

91
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,230
You're the one who's going to die if you don't follow the syndicate's orders.

92
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,430
Don't make me do it.

93
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,480
Huang, don't!

94
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,900
Alley cats should shut the fuck up!

95
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,110
Don't do it, Hei!

96
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,380
Episode Sixteen

97
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,380
Memories of Betrayal

98
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,380
in an Amber Smile...

99
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,380
(Part Two)

100
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,150
Hey, can I ask you something?

101
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,740
Why would a contractor like you work for human beings?

102
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,870
We're the chosen ones.

103
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,360
They're afraid of us because they can't sign contracts,

104
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,530
which makes sense.

105
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,400
An existence with newly acquired powers has emerged.

106
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,830
An existence fit to establish a new world order.

107
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,890
Is that part of Amber's manifesto?

108
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,970
Amber wouldn't say something like that.

109
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:46,920
I was told that the tragedy that took place in South America had to be repeated in this city.

110
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Why?

111
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,190
I don't know,

112
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,610
but it must be important since Amber was the one who said it.

113
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,930
You'd probably understand.

114
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,320
The reason for our group's conception and course of action.

115
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,810
We, the Evening Primrose, invite you.

116
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,370
Come with us.

117
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,890
What kind of benefits do I receive if I join your little club?

118
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,520
The future.

119
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,370
In your situation, you don't have much of a choice.

120
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,030
Decide rationally, November 11.

121
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:45,430
Oh, pardon me. I just remembered saying the same thing to a certain contractor.

122
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,550
What do you think he did?

123
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,370
He attacked me with everything he had,

124
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,280
even though he only had a slight chance to win.

125
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,860
I couldn't rationalize why a contractor like that would exist.

126
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:10,390
His train of thought and principles of life... The more I thought about it, the more I became confused.

127
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,850
How touching. Are you going to follow his example?

128
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,620
No, I take pride in being a contractor.

129
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,400
That's why I've come to a rational decision.

130
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,760
What's that?

131
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,820
I refuse.

132
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,410
Freeze! Don't move!

133
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,520
Slowly put your hands behind your head.

134
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,950
You're like a knight in shining armor, Misaki.

135
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,810
Who are they?

136
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,050
The ones responsible for the explosions.

137
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm glad you're not hurt.

138
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,150
Your partner led me here.

139
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,160
Partner?

140
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,880
Yes, July-kun.

141
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,430
You'll definitely come to us.

142
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,710
You'll definitely seek us out.

143
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:32,050
Shining across the Milky Way... Yearning, yet distraught.

144
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,830
If that is what fate has decided, I will not hinder you.

145
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,060
Nobody will.

146
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,260
I couldn't make him join us.

147
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,070
I have to apologize.

148
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,250
Where is Amber?

149
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,710
I already told you. She's waiting for the final key.

150
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,350
Who could she be waiting for while leaving me behind?

151
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,490
Is it someone that important?

152
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,860
Maybe...

153
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,340
There's no need for you to know.

154
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,630
Tell me!

155
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,490
I'll tell her what happened.

156
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,640
Head to the second meeting point. Got it?

157
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,540
That was an order from Amber.

158
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,080
There was one time when he actually laughed from the bottom of his heart.

159
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,100
His sweet smile captivated me.

160
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,060
That's when I thought to myself,

161
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,470
"You really did it this time."

162
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,660
I felt as if I could do anything for him.

163
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,190
I'd do anything to see that smile again...

164
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,140
I'm sure you feel the same way.

165
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,280
Me?

166
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,080
Yes.

167
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,080
Look after him, okay?

168
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,510
Li-san?

169
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,270
What happened to you?

170
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,810
Where are you going?

171
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,760
If you're going that way...

172
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,780
You must be the one called Hei.

173
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,770
Amber always talks about you.

174
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,630
"Thank you."

175
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,810
It was the first time I was able to say it without thinking.

176
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,580
That's why I was happy,

177
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,780
but I'm not anymore.

178
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,910
This is what you would call jealousy, isn't it?

179
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,830
Amber always talks about you.

180
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,810
That's why I won't let you through.

181
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,040
I said I won't let you see her!

182
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,190
I forgot to tell you something.

183
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,120
Good boys shouldn't be up this late.

184
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,170
Get out of my way!

185
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,130
Go after the man who ran away.

186
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,580
That ability... He's the contractor you're looking for.

187
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,020
But...

188
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,790
I have to teach that mischievous boy a lesson.

189
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,660
Don't worry. July's by my side.

190
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,060
Hurry, Misaki.

191
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,460
Come on.

192
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,520
If you want to fight me that badly,

193
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,860
come and get me!

194
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,860
Prints.

195
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,340
They're everywhere.

196
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,470
I set traps on everything you're capable of freezing.

197
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,350
You won't be able to attack me.

198
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,170
Come and get me if you can.

199
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,210
You're supposed to be an excellent contractor, aren't you?

200
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,590
I don't need you, Hei, or Amagiri.

201
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm the contractor best suited for Amber.

202
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,900
But...

203
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,810
Show me! Prove that you're stronger than I am!

204
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,420
We can do it.

205
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,640
See? I'm far better than he is.

206
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,190
You don't need anyone else, do you?

207
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,780
I'm the best, aren't I?

208
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,910
Isn't that right, Amber?

209
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,290
He'll be here soon.

210
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,670
See?

211
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,400
Are you hurt? Let me see!

212
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,150
You've grown, Hei.

213
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,170
I don't have any intention of forgiving a traitor.

214
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,670
Before I kill you, there's something I need to ask.

215
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,130
What happened during that incident?

216
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,230
Where did my sister go?

217
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,430
Don't you have anything to say before that?

218
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,260
Like "it's been a while",

219
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,360
or "you look as pretty as ever".

220
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,540
Answer me, Amber!

221
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,610
Do you want to see Pai?

222
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,980
Should I take you to her?

223
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,280
Where is she?

224
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,800
Somewhere far, yet really close.

225
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,880
Come with me, Hei.

226
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,490
If you do, I'll take you to her,

227
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,080
but the city lights might vanish.

228
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,690
What are you going to do, Hei?

229
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,590
Don't screw around with me.

230
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,010
Freeze!

231
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,420
No...

232
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,280
Move, Amber!

233
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,750
Hei, I've traveled very far,

234
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,770
even across the plane of time.

235
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,830
I wanted to see you ever since that day.

236
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,750
Always, always...

237
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,260
I've always wanted to see you.

238
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,110
See you later.

239
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,860
Let's go.

240
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:28,160
There's a limit on your remuneration, so use it wisely!

241
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,170
Wasn't that the right time to use it?

242
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,660
Star-sama, do not fear.

243
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:42,260
It is not yet time to radiate. Your time will come.

244
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,900
How did everything go?

245
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,920
I was able to split the enemy lines, at least.

246
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,690
All we need to do is wait.

247
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,940
Are you sure we need that man?

248
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,700
Yes, if we want the Evening Primrose to reach full bloom.

249
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,400
Maki should have arrived before I did.

250
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,110
No, he won't be coming.

251
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:40,390
I don't like that word because it makes me feel lonely,

252
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:46,900
but I have to say good-bye properly.

253
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,010
Amber...

254
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,070
What's this? Revenge on my behalf?

255
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,560
That's not funny.

256
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,120
Neither was your joke.

257
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,680
Huang, are you alive?

258
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,390
Yeah. It looks like I'm the one with nine lives.

259
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,090
Did he hold back?

260
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,330
A contractor like him, fucking around with me...

261
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,410
Suddenly, you realize that what was thought to be unattainable

262
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,390
is close at hand.

263
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,590
But it is a happiness not destined for you.

264
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,630
Serenity and trivial conversation.

265
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,300
Being both happy and sad over petty things,

266
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,390
crying over concerns not worth bothering with.

267
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,390
Too sullied to live in such a manner.

268
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,420
And then, you understand that those days will not go on.

269
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,230
