2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,940
You came after all.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,110
Amber...

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,410
Thanks, Yin.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,160
Everyone died, didn't they?

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,480
Sorry, I don't have much time left.

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,300
There's no doubt that something's going on in there.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,300
What are we supposed to do? It would be pretty pathetic to launch a two-man attack.

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,110
It's Ohtsuka.

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,770
What's going on?

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,420
What kind of question is that? There's nobody from the division here, and...

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:42,640
Open

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:42,810
Open

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,640
Open

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,730
Open

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,310
What in the world is going on?

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:45,810
Open

18
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:45,900
Open

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,560
Open

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:46,650
Open

21
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:46,810
Open

22
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,310
Open

23
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,340
To be honest, I'm scared.

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,130
The solar maximum will enter its final stage soon.

25
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,600
Will Tokyo continue to...

26
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,000
This is insane! It's practically a war!

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

28
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,150
Hurry up! If we're going to force our way in, we have to do it while they're distracted.

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,730
You understand what this means, don't you?

30
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,020
We're up against more than contractors.

31
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,220
Hey! Wait!

32
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,110
We're now approaching the maximum activity period of the solar maximum, its final stage.

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,860
Maximum level of the Gullfinger wave acknowledged.

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,100
The anti-gate particle generation level within the accelerator ring is at maximum.

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,310
Collect all the energy from the Saturn Ring and direct it to Hope, the auxiliary convergency unit!

36
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,030
This is a race, people.

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,930
A race between the E.P.R. and human beings. There can only be one victor!

38
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,880
Activate all internal surveillance cameras.

39
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,030
Locate BK201 at once.

40
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:23,090
Not even BK201 will be able to reach the core without the aid of a doll.

41
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,290
It's merely a precautionary measure.

42
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,020
I thought a large hole would have formed here,

43
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,360
but there isn't anything at all. What a desolate place.

44
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,710
We can't move in any further.

45
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,660
This is good enough.

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,720
We couldn't even get this close in South America.

47
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,770
It doesn't look like they're angry anymore.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,730
It's probably because of that kitty cat and that child.

49
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,410
They relayed the information well.

50
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,770
I wasn't interested in the purpose of your resistance until I arrived here.

51
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,620
Did you have a change of heart?

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,680
Have you been doing this since South America?

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,500
Were you fighting against the syndicate since that time?

54
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,670
We didn't have as many members back then.

55
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,280
Besides, we didn't even realize their intentions until much later,

56
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,970
after we fought Heaven's War several times.

57
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,740
Many more stars fell back then compared to now.

58
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,660
Why we were ordered to continue spying, why we were ordered to kill,

59
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,930
it never crossed our minds at all.

60
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,400
We blindly followed the orders we were given.

61
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,740
We're contractors. All we had to do was act rationally.

62
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,130
One day, things started to change.

63
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,660
It wasn't a result of somebody taking the initiative. It just happened gradually.

64
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,930
We were referring to each other as partners before we even realized it.

65
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,400
We started sharing information.

66
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,490
Your sister was one of them.

67
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,630
Pai?

68
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,260
She was the one who initially discovered the syndicate's plans.

69
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,440
I'm not surprised you didn't know.

70
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,980
She didn't want to drag you, of all people, into it.

71
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,400
Unlike us, you've always been a human being, Hei.

72
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,920
Wouldn't it have been difficult to choose between the life of a human and a contractor?

73
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,150
That's why she...

74
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,470
Since when?

75
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,680
Since when did Pai...

76
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,720
I don't know.

77
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,250
Little by little,

78
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,290
she began to accept the fact that she had become a contractor.

79
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,250
Every time you followed the syndicate's orders,

80
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,800
she gradually became more sad and hurt.

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,670
That eventually led to a change within her.

82
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,180
Why would I know about her feelings?

83
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,980
It's because I felt the same way. That child does, too.

84
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,680
They may not have realized it yet,

85
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,050
but they are gradually changing.

86
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:13,630
I don't know who created this gate or why they did it.

87
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:19,230
All I know is that the contract we signed simply represented the beginning of something.

88
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:26,250
The beginning of something that might happen a hundred, ten thousand, or a hundred thousand years from now.

89
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,970
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

90
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,780
Why did you hide it from me?

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,430
You wouldn't have believed me unless I told you under these circumstances, would you?

92
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,300
You would have tried to escape the syndicate if I said anything, Hei.

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,920
If that happened, you wouldn't be alive today.

94
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,690
It's coming soon.

95
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,610
It?

96
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,330
The arrival of the existence that will completely erase contractors and the gate.

97
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,890
It's what we want to stop.

98
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,390
Hei,

99
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,210
do you want to see Pai?

100
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,140
The convergence beam unit is ready.

101
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,850
Executing final adjustments for core emission of anti-gate particles.

102
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,530
Presence of a chain reaction confirmed.

103
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,900
One hundred and eighty seconds until emission.

104
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,730
The Saturn System is about to enter its final stage.

105
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,830
At last, after all that time...

106
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,040
Isn't it strange?

107
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,900
I broke it and gave a piece to everyone before I came here,

108
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,040
but it reverted back to its original shape.

109
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,130
What are you trying to do?

110
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,510
I'm going to do the same thing I did in South America.

111
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,800
I'm going to release Pai's powers before it arrives.

112
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,240
When I do, no one will be able to approach this area,

113
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,220
just like Heaven's Gate.

114
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,230
Go ahead, Hei.

115
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,740
What are you asking me to do?

116
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,080
Come on. You should have realized it by now.

117
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,320
Pai has always been within you, Hei.

118
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,260
She's been with you ever since the day you thought she died.

119
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,860
The ability to conduct electricity was only one of Pai's abilities.

120
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,750
You should know the source of your powers better than anyone else.

121
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,670
Come on, Hei. Let's go meet Pai.

122
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,060
What will become of this city?

123
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,130
If I use my powers for the sake of meeting Pai,

124
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,770
what will become of the contractors, humans... everyone who lives here?

125
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,230
Will they disappear like they did in South America?

126
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,150
I can't do it.

127
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,260
Contractors as a whole will disappear if you don't.

128
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,320
Yin, me... Every single contractor on this planet.

129
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,480
Everyone except you, Hei.

130
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,330
Convergent energy will soon reach critical levels.

131
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,970
Core point at hold.

132
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,940
Focus and tolerance revisions for the lens are complete.

133
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,010
Begin the countdown.

134
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,800
Wait a second! Let me do the honors!

135
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,390
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Here we go!

136
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,400
20, 19, 18, 17,

137
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,890
We have a live feed of the core area.

138
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,910
16, 15, 14,

139
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,910
Did they back off?

140
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,610
13, 12,

141
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,610
Wait!

142
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,390
11, 10, 9,

143
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,940
BK201 won't cause the explosion!

144
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,410
8, 7, 6,

145
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,410
He's not sure about what he's doing!

146
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,370
5, 4,

147
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,370
Please wait!

148
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,550
3, 2, 1,

149
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,920
0!

150
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,170
No... No!

151
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,640
I never wanted to do this!

152
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,750
I didn't want everything to disappear!

153
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,710
What's wrong?

154
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,500
Nothing.

155
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,750
You're lying.

156
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,380
I'm not.

157
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,460
Liar.

158
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,010
I said I wasn't lying!

159
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,930
Why are you crying, Onii-chan?

160
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,870
I had known all along.

161
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,960
I knew you never wanted to kill anyone, Onii-chan.

162
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,900
In order to accept me as a contractor,

163
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,140
you've been doing things against your will, Onii-chan.

164
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,350
Wrong. I'm the Grim Reaper.

165
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,840
No, you're not.

166
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,800
You're my brother,

167
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,160
so don't push yourself too much.

168
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,940
Geez, you're always screwing around.

169
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,950
Don't bite off more than you can chew!

170
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,530
Huang?

171
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:59,140
Do you realize how many times you've pissed me off because of your indecisive nature?

172
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,440
That's what makes Hei so interesting, though.

173
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,250
Mao?

174
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,890
Who would have thought you'd be uncertain about your own identity?

175
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,180
No wonder you didn't act like a contractor.

176
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,530
Got it? You're human. You're only making things more complicated by masquerading as a contractor.

177
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,200
If you can't choose between the two, choose both!

178
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,700
A decision befitting a human being and a contractor.

179
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,220
That's right.

180
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,720
Is that really okay with you?

181
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,350
Is that your answer, Hei?

182
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,100
By choosing to assume both identities, you'll only make life more difficult on yourself.

183
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,310
The syndicate will do whatever it takes to capture you.

184
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,820
You'll have to kill again if you choose to walk that path.

185
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,070
Didn't you tell me you were sick of it?

186
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,070
You're only going to lose everything you've managed to gain again.

187
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,290
You won't be able to see the real stars or your beloved sister anymore.

188
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,220
Will you still...

189
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,340
Why?

190
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,740
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

191
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,320
That's why I...

192
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,090
Aren't you the one who's afraid of letting him choose?

193
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,700
Amber, I...

194
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,740
I don't want to hear another word.

195
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,410
Good-bye, Onii-chan.

196
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,910
Good-bye, Qing.

197
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,910
Good-bye, everyone.

198
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,920
Good-bye, Amber.

199
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,110
Hei.

200
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,770
Hei.

201
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,330
Yin!

202
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,010
Hei, come back.

203
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:22,840
Yin!

204
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,570
Don't leave me alone!

205
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,980
Hei.

206
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,040
Hei.

207
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,800
Where's Amber?

208
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,560
She used her ability one last time,

209
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,680
which is what she planned on doing from the start.

210
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,060
Let's go.

211
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,790
Convergent energy will soon reach critical levels.

212
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,440
Core point at hold.

213
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,400
Focus and tolerance revisions for the lens are complete.

214
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,400
Begin the countdown.

215
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,210
Wait a second! Let me do the honors!

216
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,490
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Here we go!

217
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,160
20, 19, 18, 17,

218
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,160
We have a live feed of the core area.

219
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,610
16, 15, 14,

220
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,180
Did they back off?

221
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,750
13, 12,

222
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,450
Wait!

223
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,520
11, 10, 9,

224
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,400
BK201 isn't at the core!

225
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
There won't be an explosion!

226
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,590
8, 7, 6,

227
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,590
The threat has been eliminated!

228
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,680
5, 4,

229
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,680
Please wait!

230
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,600
3, 2, 1,

231
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,850
0!

232
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,090
What happened?

233
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,130
I don't know.

234
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,720
A Lancer Black reaction has been detected within the Saturn Ring!

235
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,320
It's growing by the second!

236
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,300
Find out what's causing it!

237
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,790
This is...

238
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,630
BK201!

239
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,550
Take him down! Shoot him now!

240
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,120
Prepare for the second emission immediately!

241
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,970
Hurry up!

242
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,560
It's useless.

243
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,660
Useless? Why?

244
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,010
The anti-gate particles within the system have been completely altered

245
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,870
by the special particle light emitted from BK201's electric current.

246
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,460
His electric current isn't one made up of mere electromagnetic waves.

247
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,260
It's capable of altering substances at a quantum level.

248
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:52,510
Granting the abilities of a contractor to an ordinary human being is an example of what BK201 is capable of.

249
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,350
I thought the same incident that took place in South America would happen again,

250
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:01,510
where the altered substance would saturate the gate and create a neutral territory.

251
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,960
Who would have thought he'd attack the Saturn Ring with pinpoint accuracy?

252
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,460
He really outdid us this time!

253
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,110
Somebody take this man away!

254
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,070
Manager!

255
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,160
How could the syndicate terminate me?

256
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,090
We've been conducting undercover investigations on a suspect, namely Eric Nishijima,

257
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,650
on charges of conspiracy and violation of United Nation laws.

258
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,850
The perfect scapegoat, isn't he?

259
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,420
Is this your... the syndicate's method of handling things?

260
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,610
I need not remind you about how Intelligence is supposed to act.

261
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:59,030
Manager Hourai, you and Eric Nishijima, who you just killed, attempted to eliminate all contractors

262
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,620
despite the fact that the threat of an explosion didn't exist.

263
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,630
Weren't you the ones who instigated all this, not the E.P.R.,

264
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,830
in an effort to eradicate them?

265
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,260
Do you have any evidence?

266
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,710
Eventually, the time will come when the truth is disclosed. History will be the judge of your actions.

267
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,850
Don't think you can get away with it at that time.

268
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,730
The existence of the syndicate or the relationship I maintained with it,

269
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,860
you can't prove either.

270
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,750
You have no idea how influential the syndicate is.

271
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,340
However, due to this disturbance,

272
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,200
knowledge about the existence of contractors will inevitably become known to the public.

273
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,540
We should have eliminated information about them before it came to that,

274
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,520
while they were still a nameless cluster of stars.

275
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,550
That will be enough.

276
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,300
Enough?

277
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,050
I've recorded this conversation. Please come with me.

278
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,700
So you opted for a third route, huh?

279
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,000
Why don't you understand?

280
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,160
The path you've chosen is one of massive conflict.

281
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,500
The human race will abhor contractors all the more,

282
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,580
and contractors will act in kind.

283
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,800
What do you think will be the end result of that?

284
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,710
You advocate peace,

285
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,160
so there isn't any reason why you shouldn't understand what I'm trying to say.

286
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,890
No!

287
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,870
Wait!

288
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,240
Wait, Li-kun!

289
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,230
The man you once knew as Li no longer exists.

290
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,490
Boss!

291
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,530
Boss!

292
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,490
Are you all right?

293
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,590
Yes.

294
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,020
This is awful. What the hell happened?

295
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,880
Manager?

296
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,040
Saitou, arrest the manager

297
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,610
on charges of homicide.

298
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,000
Roger!

299
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,610
He might try to commit suicide, so be alert.

300
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,290
Understood!

301
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,620
In any case, let's get out of here.

302
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,070
Okay.

303
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,960
Our lives returned to normal shortly after that incident.

304
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,050
As the manager had predicted,

305
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,280
contractor-related incidents were on the rise.

306
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,000
Freeze! Slowly raise your hands and turn toward me!

307
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,720
2048 hours, suspect detained.

308
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,850
Roger.

309
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,750
There wasn't a single trace of the syndicate.

310
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,310
However, it was only a matter of time until the existence of contractors became known to the public.

311
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:21,110
One day, in the near future, our moment of truth will come.

312
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,710
That's it,

313
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,490
take them with you.

314
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,570
The stars that have fallen,

315
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,100
the stars that are falling,

316
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,730
every single one of them...

317
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,350
Yes. Far, far,

318
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:49,560
far, far away, to a future nobody has ever seen.

319
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,940
Yeah, it was really sudden.

320
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,750
Why would they deport such a nice man?

321
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,960
There are so many Japanese who are much worse than he was.

322
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,340
Would we have chosen the same path,

323
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,790
a path of coexistence?

324
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,760
Wait!

325
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,690
I wanted to hear his answer with my own ears.

326
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,780
What is it?

327
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,290
Understood. I'll be there soon.

328
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Episode Twenty-Five

329
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Does the Reaper Dream of Darkness,
Darker Than Black?

330
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,520
Ah, hello there. Matsumoto, Public Security Bureau, Foreign Affairs Section 4.

331
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,550
I was sure that this was the last episode,

332
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,580
but actually, there appears to be one more.

333
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,900
Now, in the spring comes flower-viewing.

334
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,150
The other day, even Section 4 went out to see them.

335
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,620
There, a young lady of ours, named Otsuka-kun,

336
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,850
started going on about what she liked. She says,

337
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:35,120
"I prefer men, like you, Matsumoto-san, rather than younger men."

338
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,780
What was I saying? Oh yes, the preview.

339
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,380
Episode Twenty-Six

340
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,380
Beneath Cherry Blossoms in Full Bloom...

341
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,440
Huh? Time's up? Well, if you'll excuse me...
