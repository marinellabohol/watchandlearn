2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,990
Misaki, you really like greasy food, don't you?

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,180
Well, I'm hungry.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,990
You don't get fat, either.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,270
That's because I move around every day.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,440
Kanami, what are you filling out?

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,960
Oh, the career survey.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,930
What a hassle. We're still in our first year, you know.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,090
It's not like we're thinking about our careers yet.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,340
What are you going to be?

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,390
I don't know anything about my future
so I might look into a college education,

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,810
unlike someone who's already set her academic and vocational goals.

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,430
Did you know she already decided to join the police right after she graduates from Tokyo University?

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,570
Police?

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,420
Kanami!

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,360
You really have a father complex.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,030
That's not true.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,280
Is that so?

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:03,730
My father might have suggested it,
but I have my own reasons.

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,370
Like what?

21
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:14,910
There are a lot of people in this world who seek to gain at the expense of other people's misery.

22
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,220
That's something I can't tolerate.

23
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,490
So you want to defend the weak, huh?

24
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,300
You're still the same old goody two-shoes, Misaki.

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,300
Hey, is that any way to treat me for telling you about it?

26
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,130
That's mine!

27
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,480
Hey, give it back!

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,960
Too late now!

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,780
You eat too much!

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,360
Delicious! Give me another one!

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,240
No!

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,090
Why not?

33
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,260
Today is such a wonderful day.

34
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,270
Don't you think so, Misaki?

35
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,540
Don't hide. Come out and celebrate with me.

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,610
What are you doing in a place like this?

37
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,490
Well, I was told to bring drinks to the owner,

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,620
but when I arrived...

39
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,960
At this rate, we'll be killed as well.

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,360
Try to do something.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,870
Easier said than done.

42
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,780
Even after I started using the bees, there was one thing that wouldn't disappear from this world.

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,450
That will come to an end tonight, though.

44
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,310
Everything that held me down...

45
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,710
My father,

46
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,270
Chen Long Tang...

47
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,230
Everything...

48
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,370
Wei...

49
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,420
You bastard...

50
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,710
Wei has been assisting me.

51
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,200
He's a confidant of mine.

52
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,130
Besides, today is a good day.

53
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,290
It must have been fate for us to have been reunited today.

54
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,500
When I give you the signal, run.

55
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,100
Misaki, that's why you should die for my sake and set me free.

56
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,150
I'm talking to you, Misaki.

57
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,610
Now!

58
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,140
I won't let you escape, Misaki.

59
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,640
Who are you exactly?

60
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,530
I'm from the police.

61
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,540
Aren't you a friend of the debutante?

62
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,610
What are we going to do now?

63
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,560
I'd like to get out of the building, for one.

64
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,280
Closed for
periodic inspection

65
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,580
We are very sorry.

66
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,360
We are currently in the process of
identifying the problem. Please be patient.

67
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,440
They're not allowing anyone to go downstairs.

68
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,860
How about the emergency stairwell?

69
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,270
That's definitely been closed off.

70
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,470
You cannot allow anyone to leave.

71
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,800
Is that clear?

72
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,120
Yes?

73
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,370
Yes, I understand.

74
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,670
The board meeting is over.

75
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,350
Clean up the room.

76
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,140
Sir.

77
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,660
Um... What are we going to do now?

78
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,950
I'm thinking about that right now!

79
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,820
Okay...

80
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,320
Do you have a cell phone?

81
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,910
No, carrying one around during work is against the rules.

82
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,780
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,560
It's a blackout,

84
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,640
but there's no need to worry.

85
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,650
This hotel is equipped with a proprietary power generator.

86
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,400
See?

87
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,350
Did they cut the power from the lines to
prevent observer apparitions from entering?

88
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,320
Observer apparitions?

89
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,430
It's nothing!

90
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,000
Why is this happening?

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,930
Who knows?

92
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,050
Why would Alice want to kill me?

93
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,440
She's my friend... Why?

94
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,470
You were betrayed,

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,400
poor thing.

96
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,300
What would you know about this feeling?

97
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,310
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,910
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

99
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,260
Being betrayed by a friend is probably a terrible experience.

100
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,870
Why are we talking about these things in a place like this?

101
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,930
You're right.

102
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,380
You're a strange one.

103
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,400
That's what everyone always says about me.

104
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,520
I wonder why.

105
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,490
That aside, you don't have to hide here since you haven't been seen.

106
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,830
Didn't you realize that?

107
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,230
Wait a minute... In that case,

108
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,480
can you go to the hall and bring Saitou here?

109
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,050
Once you do that, you can run
away or do whatever you want.

110
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,110
Please.

111
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,240
Okay.

112
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,320
My name is Li Shun Sheng.

113
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,740
I don't think I've introduced myself.

114
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,250
I'm Kirihara Misaki.

115
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,000
It's the first time I've introduced myself inside a toilet stall.

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,260
Me, too.

117
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,760
Misaki is inside the hotel?

118
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,410
How can that be?

119
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,730
It's the building that had its power cut off, so we can't use observer apparitions.

120
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,270
The usage of his powers has been detected.

121
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,460
It's obvious that VI952 is inside!

122
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,250
Why would she be at a place like that?

123
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,050
I already know that!

124
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,280
She can't be reached by phone, and there's no doubt something's going on there.

125
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,980
There aren't any signs of a distress signal,
and we can't conduct a search without a warrant.

126
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,110
In that case, have them issue a warrant immediately!

127
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,800
What in the world are you doing, boss?

128
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,340
Don't ask. Shut the door now!

129
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,910
Y-Yes...

130
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,970
Wei, please capture Misaki for me.

131
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,210
Otherwise, I can't be free.

132
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:51,780
Yes, it is just one woman. I shall bring her to you shortly.

133
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,570
No, you're wrong.

134
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,380
Misaki isn't alone.

135
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,200
She was with a man.

136
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,860
A man?

137
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,540
Episode Ten The White Dress, Stained with the Girl's Dreams and Blood... (Part Two)

138
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,670
Saitou, isn't there a better way?

139
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,480
You want to go outside unnoticed, don't you?

140
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,930
The best way to escape is to go down to the laundry room.

141
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,890
More importantly, what happened?

142
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,260
Everyone seems so uptight.

143
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,720
I'll explain later.

144
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,600
By the way, Li-kun,

145
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,860
what's this all ab...

146
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
What's wrong?

147
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,190
No, it's nothing.

148
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,860
You came, as expected.

149
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,780
Did you think you could use that officer as a decoy?

150
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,500
Very imprudent of you.

151
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,660
I don't know which organization you're from, but you're no match for me.

152
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,750
I will make sure you return it to me.

153
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,880
Oh, this?

154
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,890
Shedding blood is my remuneration as a contractor.

155
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,260
Shall we begin?

156
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,860
What's wrong?

157
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,570
The show has just begun.

158
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:01,170
I've heard a rumor about the existence of a proficient contractor who manipulates electricity at will.

159
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,170
I see. You're that BK201.

160
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:11,330
You intentionally lured me toward you so that I'd drop my guard.

161
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,180
However, it seems that you've made a critical mistake at the last moment.

162
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,430
Apparently, I'm faster than you are.

163
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,580
Saitou, this way.

164
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,040
But...

165
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,190
Don't panic. Act as you normally do.

166
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,030
Okay.

167
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,730
You're in charge of this room.

168
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,550
Okay.

169
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,470
There aren't any tables.

170
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,830
That was close. I almost had you.

171
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,850
Alice! What are you doing?

172
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,690
Didn't I tell you?

173
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,090
Today will be the end of everything that has been holding me down.

174
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,390
Kinship was what Chen Long Tang revered more than anything else.

175
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:44,510
That's why, as the successor by lineage,
regardless of whether I wanted to or not...

176
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,230
I had to live a life shouldering the burden of Chen Long Tang.

177
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:57,450
Even when the gate appeared and the
world was in turmoil, nothing changed.

178
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,910
However, Wang Shao Tang is dead,

179
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,730
and Chen Long Tang has disappeared without a trace.

180
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,660
All thanks to Wei Zhi Jun.

181
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,100
Boss, who is he?

182
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,330
VI952.

183
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,220
Saitou...

184
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,460
Please, Wei, set me free.

185
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,220
With this, you are now free.

186
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,580
Alice!

187
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,290
Why?

188
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,450
You didn't want freedom.

189
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:58,850
You only sought to be bound,
always relying on someone else, Alice.

190
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,960
No...

191
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,730
Sometimes it was Kirihara Misaki, and sometimes it was me.

192
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,470
You didn't want to be freed from your father,

193
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,010
but rather bound to him, didn't you?

194
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,600
Alice!

195
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,310
Alice! Alice!

196
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,650
You're a heartless person.

197
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:37,620
Haven't you realized you were the one who liberated Alice from her dependency on her father?

198
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,200
What did you say?

199
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:47,180
It was the first time someone questioned her father's authority.

200
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,610
Your father has nothing to do with this!

201
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,030
That's when she found another person to rely on.

202
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,240
However, you became a police officer,

203
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,250
a person deemed unacceptable in the world of Wang Shao Tan's daughter.

204
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,800
It can't be...

205
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,130
Boss!

206
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,600
Saitou!

207
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,680
Get out of the way!

208
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,570
BK... 201...

209
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,000
How... are you still...

210
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,230
So that was your own blood...

211
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:08,380
In an instant... That can't be...

212
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,150
It looks like I was faster than you.

213
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,770
Hold it!

214
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,640
Wei Zhi Jun attempted to take
complete control of Chen Long Tang,

215
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:58,050
killing Wang and the executives, as well as the daughter, for good measure.

216
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:02,070
He also tried to frame you as the suspect.

217
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:09,170
Strangely enough, Wei's corpse disappeared from the morgue.

218
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,720
As I thought.

219
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,370
His star didn't fall that night.

220
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,450
The mission is over.

221
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,530
Do you think I would have been able
to save Alice if I didn't join the police?

222
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,810
Who knows?

223
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,620
No one can read people's minds or predict the future.

224
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,300
Then again, can you imagine yourself as someone who isn't an officer?

225
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,030
Kanami... when did you start smoking?

226
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:59,580
I'm also a weak person who has to
depend on something in order to live.

227
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,640
There are a lot of people who rely on you.

228
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,100
However, you have a bad habit of
shouldering the entire burden by yourself.

229
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,320
It'll be a problem if you don't come to my aid when I ask you for help.

230
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,200
I see.

231
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,930
Would you mind not smoking next to me, though?

232
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,920
My clothes are going to smell.

233
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,580
You're going to decline the promotion?

234
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,450
Yes.

235
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,760
Can you tell me why?

236
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,160
I realized my shortcomings during the most recent case.

237
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,370
I cannot go further as of yet.

238
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,000
I was unable to save someone who only I could have saved.

239
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,700
Do you know the consequences of rejecting an offer like this?

240
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,150
I stand firm in my decision.

241
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,650
Very well. Inspector Kirihara, you may leave.

242
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,000
Sir.

243
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,540
Boss, is something wrong?

244
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,750
Why do you ask?

245
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,820
It was just a thought.

246
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,520
Don't say things on a whim.

247
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,050
Yes, I'm sorry.

248
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,090
Saitou, I'm counting on you.

249
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,350
Did you say something?

250
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,010
It's nothing.

251
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,920
Referred to as "Hell's Gate"...

252
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,830
A strange field, a discontinuous space-time,

253
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,820
randomly and arbitrarily distorted physical laws.

254
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,880
The Pandora's Box of a dubious science beyond one's grasp.

255
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:05,350
In exchange, mankind has lost multitudes of lives, part of a continent, genuine stars in the sky,

256
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,340
Episode Eleven When One Takes Back What Was Lost Within the Wall... (Part One)

257
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,950
and its sanity.
