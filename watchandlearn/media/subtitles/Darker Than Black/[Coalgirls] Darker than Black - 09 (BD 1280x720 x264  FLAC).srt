2
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,680
Richard Lau?

3
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,590
Yeah.

4
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,700
Is it true that you have information regarding the contractor?

5
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,090
It's true.

6
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,480
I'll tell you everything,

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,350
as long as you guarantee my safety.

8
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,590
That depends on the quality of the information.

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,900
I know about the person you've been frantically looking all over the city for.

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,630
Is it VI952?

11
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,740
Yeah.

12
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,880
Take me...

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,990
Very well.

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,050
You'll be put under our protection.

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,030
You'll also be provided with a new identity.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,650
However, the information comes first.

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,910
I know.

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,290
His name is...

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,510
Hey...

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,500
What's on your back?

21
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,790
What's wrong?

22
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,510
What are you doing?

23
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,320
Boss, are you okay?

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,040
I'm fine.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,890
Contact the division manager at once.

26
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,060
Call forensics. Preserve the crime scene until they arrive.

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,620
Roger.

28
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,570
It looks like it's a material teleportation-type ability,

29
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,990
although he uses it in a pretty gruesome way.

30
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:06,880
Apparently, the boss saw some kind of correlation between the bloodstain and the area of mutilation.

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,640
There's no doubt that it's the face of Richard Lau,

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,370
known as Wang Shao Tang's right hand man. What a pitiful fate.

33
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,440
Are you all right?

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,690
What?

35
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,180
I'm just frustrated.

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,420
Hey, come on.

37
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,070
You can't go in.

38
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,810
No, I'm...

39
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,520
An incident just occurred, so this area is off limits to unauthorized personnel.

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,970
Um, I'm...

41
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,910
Father?

42
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,610
Who is he?

43
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,180
Superintendent Kirihara Naoyasu, head of security at the National Police Agency.

44
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,040
This makes nine cases, doesn't it?

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,950
The victims are all officials from the mafia situated in Hong Kong, Chen Long Tang.

47
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,820
It's either a feud between organizations or an internal power struggle.

48
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,980
Do you have any ideas about the perpetrator?

49
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:17,580
From the nature of the homicides, it has been determined to be the acts of a single contractor.

50
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,940
Its Messier Code is...

51
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,770
VI952.

52
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,340
Don't ask if you already know about it.

53
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,690
You don't have to act so distant.

54
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,450
Working hours are already over.

55
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,720
The case hasn't been solved yet!

56
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,730
How about we go out to dinner?

57
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,540
I'm telling you...

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,690
Do I need to order you as the Superintendent of Security,

59
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,930
Chief Kirihara?

60
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,950
In that case, let me choose where we go.

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,480
Of course.

62
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,050
What were you thinking?

63
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,530
You didn't have to choose this hotel.

64
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,070
It's delicious, though.

65
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,790
I'm not talking about that.

66
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,590
This hotel is owned by Wang Shao Tang.

67
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,640
So what?

68
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,370
Wang might be a hotel owner to the general public,

69
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,190
but he's actually the boss of Chen Long Tang.

70
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,490
Even a child knows that here in Shinjuku.

71
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:24,990
Then...

72
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,210
I can't leave the immediate vicinity due to search obligations.

73
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,710
Besides, I'm only here to eat.

74
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,100
Just act like you normally do.

75
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,150
What did you want to talk about?

76
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,120
You insisted on inviting me, so it must be important.

77
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,050
There will be a notice for you in the upcoming future.

78
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,600
Congratulations, Misaki.

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,840
You're going to be a superintendent.

80
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,150
You'll probably have to be a precinct chief for a while somewhere,

81
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,150
then return to the NPA as an assistant to a councilor, though.

82
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,670
Why do you have everything planned out?

83
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,940
There's more to it than that.

84
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,410
After all, we have great expectations of the first female superintendent.

85
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,080
I'm just an attraction, then.

86
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,000
You're harsh,

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,150
but it's not like I can deny it.

88
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,680
Why did you join the police?

89
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,400
You said you wanted to become a policeman to help the weak, didn't you?

90
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,530
Yes.

91
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,540
Receiving a promotion isn't a bad thing, after all.

92
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,840
You can help more people at a position with a higher profile.

93
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,590
That might be true, but...

94
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,940
There's still time before the order becomes official.

95
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,650
Be prepared for it.

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,400
Well, don't do anything reckless.

97
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,680
I know.

98
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,810
Misaki!

99
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,620
Alice?

100
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,290
You came, after all. Thanks!

101
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,800
Oh, so it was for another reason.

102
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,660
What is it? Work?

103
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,800
Y-Yes.

104
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,720
Don't you remember what day it is today?

105
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,490
Today?

106
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,820
Yes, today's my birthday.

107
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,190
That's why I thought you came over.

108
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,850
Sorry.

109
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,720
It is time, Alice-sama.

110
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,680
Misaki, do you remember?

111
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,610
Wei Zhi Jun, my bodyguard since high school.

112
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,610
Yes...

113
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,560
It has been quite a while.

114
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,490
Say, stop by if you have some time.

115
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,080
But...

116
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,170
I'll show you places the police could never gain access to.

117
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,460
I will see you later.

118
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,050
There aren't any cameras.

119
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,510
The penthouse my father and I live in is on the top floor.

120
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,340
It's a private area that unauthorized people can't enter.

121
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,160
That's why there aren't any cameras.

122
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,710
It goes without saying that the police have never been here.

123
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,770
I see.

124
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,840
Say, wasn't the food downstairs delicious?

125
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,340
Y-Yes.

126
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,280
You were eating there after all!

127
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,280
You still like greasy food, don't you?

128
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,530
You're going to get fat.

129
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,450
I'll be fine, since I move around every day.

130
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,980
It feels like we've had this conversation before!

131
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,060
It really does.

132
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,120
You finally smiled.

133
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,550
Were you nervous?

134
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,860
No...

135
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,100
I was just surprised since I ran into you so unexpectedly.

136
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,930
I-Isn't the slit too high?

137
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,530
That's your punishment for forgetting about my birthday.

138
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,990
Alice!

139
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,710
You're going to dress like that for the party, okay Misaki?

140
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,340
All right.

141
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,770
Hey!

142
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,090
It looks good on you.

143
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,960
You too, Alice.

144
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,900
Isn't it strange?

145
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,380
The daughter of Wang Shao Tang and a chief inspector from the metropolitan police, together like this.

146
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,690
What are you doing?

147
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,330
You shouldn't smoke!

148
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,780
It's none of your business.

149
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,170
Of course it is! I'm your classmate.

150
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,850
Are you making her do this?

151
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,220
No way.

152
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,590
As long as you don't get caught, I couldn't care less.

153
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,390
Kanami!

154
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,400
You heard what the class representative said. Take a hike.

155
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,260
Give it back.

156
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,490
I won't.

157
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,900
You know who I am, don't you?

158
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,750
You're Alice Wang.

159
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,110
That's not what I'm talking about.

160
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,160
My father is...

161
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,290
Your father has nothing to do with this!

162
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,200
The reason why you're smoking is either because you're a child who wants to act like an adult,

163
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,730
or a weak person who depends on something else in order to live.

164
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,150
Oh, yeah?

165
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,360
That's fine with me!

166
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,980
Whatever the hell I am has nothing to do with you!

167
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,760
Yes, it does!

168
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,500
You sit next to me in class,

169
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,160
and you stink of cigarettes!

170
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,890
Is there a problem, Alice-sama?

171
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,030
It's nothing.

172
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,430
What a strange person.

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,680
Episode Nine The White Dress, Stained with the Girl's Dreams and Blood... (Part One)

174
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,790
Happy birthday, Alice-sama.

175
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,850
Thank you.

176
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,340
Congratulations, Alice-sama.

177
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,250
Thank you.

178
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,770
Come with me. I'll introduce you to my father.

179
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,590
I'm Kirihara Misaki.

180
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,990
I'm Wang Shao Tang.

181
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,510
The qipao looks wonderful on you.

182
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,160
Chiipao?

183
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,420
He's talking about the Mandarin dress.

184
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,190
Thank you very much.

185
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,540
I hear about you all the time.

186
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,800
It seems Alice is fortunate to have such a good friend.

187
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
I feel the same way.

188
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,070
Give my regards to your father.

189
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,040
Enjoy yourself tonight.

190
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,430
Thank you very much.

191
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,100
What were you thinking, inviting that bitch?

192
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,440
She's a dear friend of mine.

193
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,660
That's all.

194
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,570
What's with that attire?

195
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,170
A Japanese wearing a qipao, and you in a Western dress?

196
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,490
Doesn't it look nice?

197
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,110
You xenophile.

198
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,540
Oh well... Speaking of the police, it looks like they're on our tails.

199
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,640
Be careful.

200
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,090
You too, father.

201
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,420
I'm going upstairs for a while.

202
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,420
Well, it probably doesn't have anything to do with us.

203
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,900
Would you like a drink?

204
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,620
Saitou!

205
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,420
You did a nice job of sneaking in, boss.

206
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,200
It just ended up this way.

207
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,970
Even so, isn't that outfit a bit revealing?

208
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,580
Shut up.

209
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,440
More importantly, how are things?

210
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,800
It seems like they still don't know who's killing off their executives.

211
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,410
Although it's been dubbed as the daughter's birthday party,

212
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,780
it's actually an emergency board meeting.

213
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,600
They decided to assemble the executives at a time like this?

214
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,080
He's testing their loyalty.

215
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,080
He's basically saying "you're not qualified to be an executive if you're scared of something like this".

216
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,650
W-What?

217
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,930
Oh, it's you, Li-kun.

218
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,270
Li-kun?

219
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,580
He eats a lot for a guy his size.

220
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,580
I don't know whether to call it gluttony or something else, but...

221
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,390
You again!

222
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,040
Again?

223
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,450
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,640
Instead of being here, go inside and wash the dishes!

225
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,460
Okay.

226
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,130
What are you up to, Saitou?

227
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,770
You're a lucky one, picking up women during work.

228
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,020
Ouch! It's not like that!

229
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,630
No excuses. You're going to wash dishes, too. Come on now!

230
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,140
Ow!

231
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,240
Saitou... Infiltrating under his real name...

232
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
That idiot!

233
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,150
Li-kun, you went there?

234
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:16,180
Yes. I made a wrong turn, and I was surrounded by those scary people.

235
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,830
I thought I wasn't going to make it back alive.

236
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,930
It's your fault for getting too close to that elevator.

237
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:29,460
It's a direct connection to the top floor, exclusively for the owner and his daughter,

238
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,740
so security's going to be tight.

239
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,020
You know a lot about it, Saitou-san.

240
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,550
No, I only know a little.

241
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,540
No matter how many dishes you wash, there doesn't seem to be an end in sight.

242
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,750
You're right.

243
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,300
That manager... Making me do this just because I was talking on the job...

244
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,360
Do you know her?

245
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,510
The woman in the Mandarin dress.

246
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,180
It looked like you two were close.

247
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,010
A little.

248
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,400
She's pretty.

249
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,200
No way. Looks can be deceiving.

250
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,050
She's really scary.

251
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,090
Is that so?

252
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,330
Oh, yeah.

253
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,640
That's right.

254
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,620
They must be the executives.

255
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,990
You can't go in there.

256
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,510
I can't even let you near that room, Misaki.

257
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,590
I'll give you a piece of information instead,

258
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,250
and an important one at that.

259
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,800
Don't you want to know the identity of VI952?

260
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,480
There aren't any guards around.

261
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,790
Stone...

262
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,960
Yes, stone flowers.

263
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,650
However, unlike a synthetic, they actually grow.

264
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,990
There's no way...

265
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,790
Yes. They were smuggled from the gate.

266
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,810
The honey bees that feed off this stone flower

267
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,950
can create a special substance within their bodies.

268
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,470
Alice...

269
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,310
My pain and sorrow will disappear with this.

270
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,560
My world, radiant with light, will now begin.

271
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,150
Do you want to try it, Misaki?

272
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,240
Here!

273
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,300
Wei, where's the boss?

274
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,810
It's way past schedule.

275
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,500
I don't see his daughter, either.

276
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,360
Why are you laughing, Wei Zhi Jun?

277
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,600
If you're talking about Wang Shao Tang, he won't be joining us.

278
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,620
What?

279
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,230
This is the beginning of a new era for Chen Long Tang.

280
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,150
What are you saying?

281
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,810
This wound is...

282
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,420
Wei did it.

283
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,030
Wei Zhi Jung is VI952.

284
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,210
Alice, you...

285
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,690
Farewell, Misaki.

286
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,260
Farewell.

287
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,450
Misaki!

288
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,210
Oh, hello.

289
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,930
Betrayal induces further betrayal,

290
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,530
and blood thirsts for more blood.

291
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,780
Residual thoughts have nowhere to go

292
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,160
and begin distorting at the brink of appetence and despondency.

293
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,580
Is it really something you can call a betrayal?

294
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,240
The enigma takes the form of a thorn, pricking the innocent soul into a bloody state.

295
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,130
This wasn't what I had intended.

296
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,680
The girl's dream decays into futility.

297
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,320
