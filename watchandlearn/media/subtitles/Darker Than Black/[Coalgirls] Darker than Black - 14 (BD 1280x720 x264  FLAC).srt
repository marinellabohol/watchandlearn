2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,580
Yes? Yes.

3
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,570
Mama?

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,170
What's wrong, Mama?

5
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,010
The flight... Papa's flight...

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,360
Do you really think you'll be able to kill Yin when you find her?

7
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,830
She's just a doll.

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,810
Why did you save her the other day?

9
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,100
I have a lead. They're trying to get far away.

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,470
I'll leave it to you.

11
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,180
Does your power always have to be so extravagant?

12
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,530
Aren't spectacles fascinating?

13
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,790
It's more like La traviata than it is Aida.

14
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,390
I'm serious.

15
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,120
In that case, I'll explain it to you seriously.

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,250
All particles vibrate,

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,950
so when I hit them with their vibrational frequency, they'll begin to resonate.

18
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,040
In other words, the vibration is amplified to the point of destruction. Do you get it?

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,400
Sort of.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,130
In any case, that's what my ability is about.

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,010
That's why I can destroy any object I want,

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,310
even the most obscure of things.

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,870
Yeah, and the original chestnut glutton rice, harvest rice kokeshi doll, and...

24
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,620
Boss, lend me some money.

25
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,490
We also need to buy something to eat.

26
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,300
You're on the job, you know. What are you going to do if you get drunk?

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,260
No problem! I fall asleep whenever I get drunk.

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,200
No, that's not the issue.

29
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,630
Why don't you want to go home, Kirsi?

30
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,820
Aren't you happy about going back to your homeland?

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,680
I'm not going.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,870
Why not?

33
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,170
I don't know.

34
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,000
Kirsi, how do I say this...

35
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,660
You're not the same person I once knew.

36
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,330
I heard there were many people who became like you after a certain point in time.

37
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,770
Your emotions seem unstable... Yes, you must be ill.

38
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,690
Listen to me.

39
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,930
Go back with me.

40
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,930
I'm not going.

41
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,290
Kirsi...

42
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,330
I'm not go...

43
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,820
I tried to find you whenever I was on tour abroad.

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,480
Why?

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,480
Why, you ask?

46
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,780
Mr. Kastinen, about the money for our expenses... Can you cast it in?

47
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,410
I knew you were going to say that. That wasn't even funny.

48
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,380
Look at the guy next to the cop who's inspecting everyone.

49
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,950
He's trying to trace the connection I'm transmitting.

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,530
Are they looking for contractors?

51
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,940
Cut the line already.

52
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,110
It's already been done.

53
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,860
It might have been a little too late.

54
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,570
Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?

55
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,780
Hey! Hey! Get a hold of yourself!

56
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,790
Was that one of your abilities?

57
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,080
An unimpressive one, at that.

58
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,780
I made his heart vibrate sympathetically, which made it come to a halt.

59
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,090
My remuneration won't change, regardless of whether it's spectacular or not.

60
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,850
We only know that much right now.

61
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,420
I'm continuously receiving information from our superiors.

62
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,180
Can you find out where she is at any time?

63
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,690
That's how it is.

64
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,480
It means that no one can escape the grasp of the syndicate.

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,500
If people like you weren't associated with us, you'd probably be a bunch of serial killers or renegades.

66
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,670
Be grateful you're on our side.

67
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,850
My ass is on the line, so hurry up and go after her.

68
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,110
How's the connection?

69
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,140
Still broken. There needs to be water nearby.

70
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,090
That's a tough remuneration you have.

71
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,840
To tell you the truth, it doesn't have to be cigarettes.

72
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,690
Anything will do, as long as I put it inside my mouth and spit it back out.

73
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,700
It's a habit from your days as a human, isn't it?

74
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,500
It looks like luck's on our side.

75
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,390
We will be stopping to allow the oncoming train to pass.

76
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,000
The delay will be approximately five minutes.

77
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,420
Kirsi, are you sure someone's...

78
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,540
They're coming after us.

79
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,070
Hey, where are those two?

80
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,900
Now isn't the time to be sleeping! You could have at least watched over them while I was using the toilet!

81
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,100
Damn. We're getting off at the next station!

82
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,220
Come on. Wake up!

83
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,330
No, you can't touch me there...

84
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,410
What are you taking pictures of? That could be considered voyeurism.

85
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,990
Hey! N-No...

86
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,220
I'm going to find something to burn. Wait inside.

87
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,130
Kirsi?

88
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,400
Episode Fourteen A Heart Unswaying on the Water's Surface... (Part Two)

89
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,400
Go ahead. Play it.

90
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,190
I had a daughter in the past. An infant baby.

91
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,490
Her father was a creep. I broke up with him shortly after she was born.

92
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,050
She was unbelievably adorable,

93
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,520
just like an angel.

94
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,500
Even though I was a singer, I was a heavy smoker. Sad, isn't it?

95
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,030
I stopped smoking while she was in my womb,

96
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,150
but I should have stopped for good.

97
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,520
I carelessly left a cigarette somewhere within her grasp.

98
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,960
She put it inside her mouth. Before I realized it, she had already choked to death.

99
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,410
It was so sudden.

100
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,830
I wept for the next several nights. Before I knew it, the night sky had changed.

101
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,370
Why did you save her the other day?

102
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,730
Kirsi?

103
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,360
Mama...

104
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,770
Kirsi...

105
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,240
You were thinking about that night, weren't you?

106
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,360
I think I know why you don't want to go back.

107
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,840
You have sad memories of your homeland, which is why...

108
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,120
Sad?

109
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,140
Wrong.

110
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,120
Isn't that what it was?

111
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,610
Kirsi...

112
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,700
The sadness, as well as everything else...

113
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,710
I remember it. I remember everything.

114
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,640
If I didn't run outside that day, Mama wouldn't have died.

115
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,270
Kirsi, that's...

116
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,710
Ever since that night, it disappeared...

117
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,600
The silver light.

118
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:41,090
"Bearing the sins of the children of Earth, the moon begins to consume its light."

119
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,160
Which poem is that from?

120
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,670
I don't remember.

121
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,650
It might have been a stanza from an aria.

122
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,420
They say that a lunar eclipse is a symbol of atonement.

123
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:56,860
In that case, the moon must be in a perpetual state of atonement, since it can't be seen anymore.

124
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,860
You're a strange contractor, too.

125
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,870
Kirsi...

126
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:11,170
There wasn't anything going on between your mother and me at that time.

127
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,060
You noticed it after all, didn't you?

128
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,530
The feelings I always kept inside of my heart.

129
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,030
Guilty thoughts about stealing your mother away.

130
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,950
I wanted to tell you... I wanted to tell you one thing.

131
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,410
You don't have to feel guilty about it, Kirsi.

132
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,500
W-Who the hell are you? You look suspicious!

133
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,980
Wait! I swear I've seen you before.

134
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,630
That's right. I saw you at the construction site when it collapsed.

135
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,020
Are you the stalker who's after the girl?

136
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,260
Go away.

137
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,920
Get away from here.

138
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,260
This is something you shouldn't be involved in.

139
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,880
What did you say? Don't screw around with me!

140
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,640
What did you do to that girl?

141
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,270
She's really quiet and doesn't show many expressions.

142
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,650
It's like she's some kind of doll!

143
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,150
Hey, wait!

144
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,130
Hey, listen!

145
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,630
Even if it doesn't show in her expressions or her words, she's crying within her heart.

146
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,160
Understand?

147
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,660
There isn't a single person in this world that deserves to be treated like a doll!

148
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,170
Maybe so.

149
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,390
What?

150
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,580
Someone's coming.

151
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,870
All the way out here?

152
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,570
Who?

153
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,010
Hei.

154
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,410
Who are you?

155
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,580
Why did you take Yin?

156
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,170
Yin? Are you talking about Kirsi?

157
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,540
What are you people up to?

158
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,380
Wrong.

159
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,010
Kirsi...

160
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,590
Wrong.

161
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,850
Did you run away on your own?

162
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,270
Why?

163
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,060
I thought my soul would be able to move forward.

164
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,490
Is she being chased because of you?

165
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,280
Are you her partner in crime or something?

166
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,630
Partner?

167
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,780
That's right.

168
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,930
Kirsi!

169
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,580
An earthquake?

170
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,330
Run away!

171
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,810
He's the one from the other day.

172
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,950
What are we supposed to do? Is collecting information still our top priority?

173
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,450
Leave the doll. He's coming.

174
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,370
H-How?

175
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,580
I see... You defibrillated your own heart with electricity.

176
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,170
Bertha!

177
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,750
I'm through with you, Yin. You're also...

178
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,360
Itzhak...

179
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,160
What kind of light is this?

180
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,160
I can't see anything anymore.

181
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,980
It's like...

182
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,200
the moonlight.

183
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,720
Bertha...

184
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:20,850
Maiden, black night, mourning in sadness,

185
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,500
falling into the night alone.

186
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,010
The moon that accompanies her radiates of silver,

187
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:36,530
as the night of atonement quietly passes by.

188
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,140
That wasn't bad.

189
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,470
That's ridiculous.

190
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,180
Dolls can't shed tears.

191
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,800
Welcome.

192
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,470
Cold sake.

193
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,460
Coming right up.

194
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,430
I heard you ran into trouble with a doll.

195
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,940
Don't look.

196
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,460
Don't worry. I won't make an issue out of this since there wasn't any harm done.

197
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,200
It's been assumed that the contractors you disposed of were from the FSB.

198
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,150
If they had received the information, you'd already be...

199
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,540
Here you go.

200
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,210
Turn in the doll.

201
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,530
It'll be reset.

202
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,870
No, I've only started to get the feel of using it.

203
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,880
Very well.

204
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,110
Thanks.

205
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,470
Don't let your emotions get the best of you.

206
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,890
Emotions? Idiot.

207
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,390
Kastinen?

208
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,860
There was no doubt it was him, so I tried to start a conversation.

209
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,480
He looked at me as if he never saw me before.

210
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,800
It might have been his way of saying you should forget about it.

211
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,910
He's probably worried that it might become a well-known scandal.

212
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,830
He looked strange, as if his memory was erased.

213
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,240
No way.

214
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,280
Speaking of which, that girl...

215
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,840
Are you talking about Kirsi-chan?

216
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,230
Right. She was back at the tobacco shop.

217
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,430
Did those two not get along?

218
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,870
Well, there's no point in prying into a private matter.

219
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,020
We received our payment, and you even went to the hot spring.

220
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,340
Well, I didn't have much of a choice after you deserted me, did I?

221
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,240
You didn't have a choice? Any reasonable person would have come back after finding out they've been deserted!

222
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,450
Well, everyone was looking forward to it.

223
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,450
What are you talking about?

224
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,420
Let's go back, Kirsi.

225
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,590
Let's return.

226
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,190
There's no reason for you to be caught up in your past anymore.

227
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,300
Hei...

228
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,810
Am I your partner?

229
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,760
Kirsi?

230
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,300
It's up to you to decide

231
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,020
whether you want to remain here as Yin or be someone else.

232
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,950
Decide?

233
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,440
Me?

234
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,380
Let's go back, Kirsi.

235
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,810
Kirs...

236
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,440
Yin.

237
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,140
Yin.

238
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,250
Kirsi...

239
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,510
Are you okay with this, Yin?

240
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,640
The sun shines a somber glitter as the hag sings.

241
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,960
The recurring destruction is a requiem for the lost past.

242
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,170
Is the remuneration for betrayal blood or tears?

243
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,550
The chain reaction of indignation has started and cannot be stopped.

244
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,540
The town is full of chaos and dissonance.

245
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Episode Fifteen Memories of Betrayal in an Amber Smile... (Part One)

246
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,260
The stage has been set.
