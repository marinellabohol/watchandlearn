2
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,330
It's me.

3
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,650
I see. Good work.

4
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,540
It's the beginning of a war.

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,020
Why did you come here?

6
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm sorry. You're the only person I know outside of the organization, Li-san.

7
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,980
Do you have any idea who that girl is?

8
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,070
Aniki told me she was some sort of merchandise.

9
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,040
Why did you bring her here if you already knew that?

10
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,080
I'm infatuated with her! I've decided to make her happy!

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
How?

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,760
How? Well, that's...

13
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,970
I'll find a way.

14
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,160
Why... Why are you so upset?

15
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,490
What are you going to do about the organization?

16
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,100
I don't have any other choice but to leave.

17
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,230
I'm sure Aniki's angry.

18
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,520
I'm going to run away from Tokyo with her.

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,100
There's no way you could pull that off.

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,140
I won't know until I try!

21
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,390
I'm an idiot who doesn't know how the world works,

22
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:53,210
but I believe she'll never be happy if she stays here.

23
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,930
Definitely.

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,690
You don't understand anything at all.

25
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,010
Did Kenji do this to you?

26
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,190
Yes.

27
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,890
Did he run away with the doll?

28
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,010
Probably.

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,860
That punk... He did this at the worst possible moment.

30
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,990
What are you going to do?

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,000
Ask the customer to wait a little longer.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,020
Tell him I'll think about giving him a discount depending on how things turn out.

33
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,630
But...

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,440
Why do you think I had the old man killed?

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,470
I'm more concerned about how many officials I can extort before the turmoil subsides.

36
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,310
I need the money.

37
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,130
If you understand what I'm saying, leave!

38
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,920
Sir!

39
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,660
Listen, you guys. Find them at once!

40
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,410
Don't lay a finger on the girl.

41
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,930
Kill the guy if you have to.

42
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,780
Roger!

43
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,530
Oh, doesn't that sweater look cute?

44
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,040
Hey, aren't you done shopping?

45
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,170
Geez.

46
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,220
BK201?

47
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,030
Don't move.

48
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,180
Slowly turn this way.

49
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,180
Li-kun?

50
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,380
Oh, Kirihara-san.

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,100
It's been a while.

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,850
It really has.

53
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,340
How have you been?

54
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,210
Um... This is...

55
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,350
Who's he?

56
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,490
Um... How should I explain this?

57
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,850
Good question.

58
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,190
It's okay. Say no more.

59
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,280
Hey, don't misunderstand.

60
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:08,300
I'd understand if he was buying clothes as a present for his girlfriend, but underwear and a wig?

61
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,050
Are you jealous?

62
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,090
I told you...

63
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,390
Yeah, yeah.

64
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,570
Why do you think it's a present?

65
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,300
Thank you for helping me with the decision.

66
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,080
Li-kun, those things weren't for you, were they?

67
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,790
Idiot.

68
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,560
N-No way!

69
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,410
A friend asked me for a favor.

70
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,900
He asked me to find a present for his girlfriend

71
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,280
since he didn't have any time.

72
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,030
Oh, I see.

73
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,930
O-Of course.

74
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,220
Please excuse me.

75
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,350
Aren't you glad it wasn't a present for his girlfriend?

76
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,190
That's enough.

77
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,940
Really? The way you were looking at him didn't seem normal.

78
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,470
That's because...

79
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,200
Li-san, you're back!

80
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,420
I do live here.

81
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,490
What is this?

82
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,640
A change of clothes.

83
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,970
There's no way she'd get very far in that outfit.

84
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,930
Li-san...

85
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,430
Thank you very much.

86
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,290
Why are you here?

87
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,330
Is she your girlfriend, Li-san?

88
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,030
She came into the room without saying a word.

89
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,350
Were you monitoring me?

90
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,470
Huang's instructions?

91
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,370
Why?

92
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,960
Hei, you seemed a little different today.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,430
Is something wrong?

94
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,320
No.

95
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,740
Help her change.

96
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,310
Are you okay with that person?

97
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,050
I apologize for the trouble I'm causing you.

98
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,100
Are you serious about this?

99
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,320
Of course.

100
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,950
Always on the run, living in fear of pursuers who might come at any moment...

101
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,540
You're going to have to run for the rest of your life.

102
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,330
I'm aware of that.

103
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,160
What about money?

104
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,750
Housing?

105
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,570
Even if you're lucky enough to find a job, how are you going to take care of her?

106
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,660
She's not even toilet trained.

107
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,050
I'll find a way.

108
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,890
Why her?

109
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,790
She doesn't understand your words or your reasoning.

110
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,670
Why are you so concerned about her?

111
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,620
Hi!

112
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,550
Oh, you're here again.

113
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,090
You're dressed up, aren't you?

114
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,010
I'm off to work, after all.

115
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,080
I don't sit around and drink all day, you know.

116
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,630
Have a good day.

117
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,610
Li-san, do you know why Eileen came to Japan?

118
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,980
She's here to earn money for her brother and sister back in her homeland.

119
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,360
She wasn't able to get a decent education, which is why she doesn't want her siblings to be in the same situation.

120
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,090
That's because they're related by blood.

121
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,130
What difference does that make? I was abandoned by my parents.

122
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,880
Eileen isn't the only one.

123
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:03,000
Louis, Joshua, and Babo... Everyone has a reason for living.

124
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,410
Li-san, don't you have it as well?

125
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,530
Something you want to protect from the bottom of your heart...

126
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,880
Sorry, I said a little too much.

127
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,510
You can't help being lovestruck, though.

128
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,840
I'll take you to the station.

129
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,010
I'll take you to Shinjuku Station.

130
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,960
Li-san...

131
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,160
Tickets to the first express out of here!

132
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,170
Any destination is fine!

133
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,210
I need two tickets now!

134
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,080
O-Okay.

135
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,420
The earliest departure is an express bound for Matsumoto.

136
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,920
I'll take it.

137
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,510
Kenji!

138
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,640
Let's go.

139
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,910
Sir, your change!

140
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,040
Hold it!

141
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,230
Don't.

142
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,960
You guys go after them.

143
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,070
I'm going to call Hitotsubashi-san.

144
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,010
Roger!

145
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,280
This is an announcement addressed to the following customer...

146
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
This way.

147
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,150
You two go on ahead.

148
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,310
What about you, Li-san?

149
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,570
We'll manage.

150
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:38,860
Li-san!

151
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,040
Let's go, Yin.

152
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,580
Episode Eighteen A Love Song Sung from a Trash Heap... (Part Two)

153
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,860
It's only the broad?

154
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,220
Where did the others go?

155
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,600
You...

156
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,880
Bastard...

157
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,320
Wait!

158
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,280
Open up!

159
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,990
Are you okay?

160
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,700
Open up! Open the door, bastards!

161
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,800
Good.

162
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,820
Good. I think we're...

163
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,810
It's dangerous to run out like that, Kenji.

164
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,270
A-Aniki...

165
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,200
If you're looking for the kid and the doll, they were caught.

166
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,220
How long have you been watching?

167
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,690
It's about time to pull out. The kid's going to die and the doll's going to be sold.

168
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,650
When that happens, they're going to find out about your involvement.

169
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,300
It'll be impossible for you to continue your mission.

170
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,190
You guys better run away at once.

171
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,390
If you're involved with that kid any longer, it'll be seen as betrayal against the syndicate.

172
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,870
Are you going to report this to Huang?

173
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,310
Give me some credit.

174
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,980
What would I gain out of telling him?

175
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,080
I'm just here to kill time,

176
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,570
since you never fail to amuse me.

177
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,070
Sorry to keep you waiting.

178
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,080
Yes, since we were the ones at fault,

179
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,970
I'll give you a discount.

180
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,640
Allow us to continue providing our services in the future.

181
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,030
Shit, open up!

182
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,880
I'll open it soon enough.

183
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,170
It'll be the last thing you'll see.

184
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,130
Damn!

185
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,070
Is it the doll's observer apparition?

186
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,490
Is it spying on us?

187
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,630
No.

188
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,040
She's calling us.

189
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,930
She's saying, "Kenji... will be killed... Save him."

190
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,140
What?

191
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,740
Are you saying that the doll sent its observer apparition on its own?

192
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,950
That's hard to believe.

193
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,940
The yakuza using the doll must have set a trap.

194
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,680
There's no other explanation.

195
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,460
What do you think?

196
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,700
You were the one who said I seemed different today.

197
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,700
Why did you think so?

198
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,980
Ask where it is.

199
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,890
Never a dull moment with you.

200
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,480
That was stupid of you, Kenji.

201
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,680
You're throwing your life away for the sake of a doll.

202
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,850
What are you saying, Aniki?

203
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,380
She isn't an object...

204
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,290
She's a girl,

205
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,290
not a doll.

206
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,300
Damn.

207
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,630
How long are you going to continue acting delusional?

208
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,390
I've decided to risk my life for her sake.

209
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,830
I can do anything as long as I have this will.

210
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,260
I dare you to find a way out of this situation, then.

211
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,160
Aniki...

212
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,200
Why are you so upset?

213
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,990
What?

214
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,490
You're the one who said it a long time ago, Aniki.

215
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,560
Have you forgotten?

216
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,590
A stun gun?

217
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,420
Shoot.

218
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,730
Aniki, stand up.

219
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,490
Get into the car, please.

220
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,110
Li-san, will you have my motorbike?

221
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,070
Please take care of it.

222
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,070
Sure.

223
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,810
Where do you want me to go?

224
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,550
Shinjuku Station.

225
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,210
All right.

226
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,350
This is the second time you've sat in the back,

227
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,180
Yeah, it is.

228
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,470
although the last time was on a motorcycle.

229
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,520
That was my first time on a bike,

230
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,760
and it was the first time I met you.

231
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,620
Yeah, it was.

232
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,700
Listen, a motorcycle isn't just a machine.

233
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,250
If you take good care of it, it'll listen to your wishes.

234
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,330
It'll never let you down.

235
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,830
Understand?

236
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,770
You probably don't.

237
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,970
I understand!

238
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,320
You do?

239
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,580
Listen, kid. Find something you want to protect with your life.

240
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,060
When you do, there isn't anything in this world you'll be afraid of.

241
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,960
You'll be able to do anything.

242
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,070
Why did you let him go?

243
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,860
What are you talking about?

244
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,360
There wasn't any ammunition left in that gun,

245
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,530
but you already knew that.

246
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,570
I wasn't aware.

247
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,050
Hey...

248
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,840
Is there something you want to protect with your life?

249
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,950
I don't have anything like that.

250
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,970
I did in the past, though.

251
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,950
I see.

252
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,840
Hey... It might be a little too late to say this, but...

253
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,960
You don't have to stay with me, you know.

254
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,660
If you don't like me, feel free to leave whenever you want to.

255
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,680
Hitotsubashi is dead.

256
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,450
It looks like a guy named Ohshita will take over the family.

257
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,690
What about our mission?

258
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,300
The trafficking route ceased to exist the moment Hitotsubashi was killed.

259
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,010
Our mission has been canceled.

260
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,770
I see.

261
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,510
What's wrong, Hei?

262
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,890
Nothing.

263
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,170
There was a response from BK201?

264
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,110
Y-Yes, but it was really faint.

265
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,390
Time and location?

266
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,040
Several minutes, starting from 19:12 last night.

267
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,930
The exact location hasn't been confirmed, but it was probably Shinjuku.

268
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,300
He was in the vicinity after all.

269
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,270
Was there any other news worth mentioning during that time?

270
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,340
It occurred a little later,

271
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,330
but there was a shooting incident at Shinjuku Station's south exit, believed to be part of a gang war.

272
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,410
A mob official was killed.

273
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,720
Shooting incident?

274
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,450
Anything else?

275
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,940
Nothing else has been reported.

276
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,710
I see.

277
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,670
All right. Thanks.

278
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,740
When will you make your next appearance, BK201?

279
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,180
Coming!

280
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,490
Sorry for all the trouble.

281
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,340
Don't worry about it. It's part of my job as a landlord.

282
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,310
Kiritanpo?

283
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,420
Don't you know what that is? It's an Akita dish.

284
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,950
Is that boy in Akita?

285
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,760
Yes.

286
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,600
This is a lot for one person.

287
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,580
I think he wanted to share this with everybody.

288
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,900
Can you distribute it to everyone?

289
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,740
What are you saying? Hand it out yourself.

290
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:27,200
What's with that face? That's common courtesy, you know.

291
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,500
The faces of those who are gone float beyond the bubble that glitters of gold.

292
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,920
The woman who lost her memory serves a smile.

293
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,130
The man who lost his love drinks a glass of despair.

294
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,470
His unabated indignity won't melt away,

295
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,450
so he continues to drink.

296
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,750
However, he cannot get drunk.

297
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Episode Nineteen Dreaming Shallow, Uninebriated... (Part One)
