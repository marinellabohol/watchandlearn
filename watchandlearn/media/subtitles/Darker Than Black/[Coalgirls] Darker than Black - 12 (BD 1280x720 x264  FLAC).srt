2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,890
Oh, it's a shooting star!

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,060
Onii-chan, I saw another shooting star!

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,880
You should make a wish next time.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,430
A wish?

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,680
Yeah. A shooting star is the light that escapes whenever God opens the lid to the sky.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,290
If you make a wish when you see one, God will listen to it.

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,210
Really? I have a lot of wishes!

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,310
I want to become a nurse and go to outer space!

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,620
There's no point in telling your Onii-chan.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,610
You have to tell the star what your wish is.

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,040
Oh, I see.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,740
Um... Star-sama, Star-sama...

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,680
Oh, I saw one!

15
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,050
Hey!

16
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,840
Turn it off already!

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,740
Okay.

18
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,010
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the disturbance!

19
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,280
Apologize to them, too!

20
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,250
I-I'm sorry.

21
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,780
You can finish this later. Let's go!

22
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,670
Okay.

23
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,000
Let us continue.

24
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,670
Upon analysis of the data obtained from the recording,

25
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,620
the location of the Lancernopt synchrotron radiation, believed to have been emitted by the meteor fragment,

26
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,110
is definitely 3-17 Sotokanda, Chiyoda Ward.

27
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,330
What is it?

28
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,850
You can see it, can't you?

29
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,120
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,850
Don't act like you don't know!

31
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,030
I've seen people like this before...

32
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,950
People who lost their composure after being forced to see an illusion against their will.

33
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,280
Please don't handle this by yourself.

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,580
You can get it off your mind if you talk about it.

35
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,000
Why?

36
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,710
That isn't part of your job, is it?

37
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,710
It'll be inconvenient for me if you go into a mental lapse now.

38
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:06,300
I realized my dreams when I came here, but I might be excused without being able to contribute any research.

39
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,310
So...

40
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,570
Don't worry.

41
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,190
The syndicate won't dispose of you.

42
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,980
Are you sure?

43
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,820
I don't think it's that simple.

44
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,080
The syndicate doesn't expect anything out of you.

45
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,610
Hurry up and leave before somebody sees us.

46
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,550
Excuse me.

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,290
I made a mistake.

48
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,080
Yes...

49
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,480
What's going on?

50
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,440
Oh, it's you.

51
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,530
Just cleaning up, as you can see.

52
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,530
Why the sudden change?

53
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,800
The synchrotron radiation confirmed during the search the other day

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,280
was determined to have originated from a precious, gate-proprietary material.

55
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,210
Unfortunately, I was appointed as a member of the retrieval team.

56
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,210
The area has been under strict restrictions ever since the accident occurred to the reconnaissance team.

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,860
I have no idea how it moved to its current location.

58
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,550
By the way, you're just in time.

59
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,060
I was thinking about giving it to you.

60
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,020
Do you want it?

61
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,560
Yes.

62
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,640
Great. That's one less thing for me to worry about.

63
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,380
Attention, all members of the Building No. 18 reconnaissance team,

64
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,470
please proceed to Gate Seven in Sector Six.

65
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,690
Duty calls.

66
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,890
Oh, sorry, but can I ask you to clean this place later?

67
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,080
Okay.

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,320
If I return safely, let's gaze at the stars again.

69
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,440
Yes, definitely.

70
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,850
May I sit here?

71
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,880
Yes, be my guest.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,740
Is something wrong?

73
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,070
No hard feelings.

74
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,990
It was your fault for giving her the cold shoulder.

75
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,340
Um, what are you talking about?

76
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,450
You don't have to act so shy.

77
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,180
Right?

78
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,130
The upturned shoes placed next to
Corinna's body... your contract payment?

79
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,170
What are you trying to do?

80
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,870
Did you obtain any information from Kikuchi?

81
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,250
I remembered he was the first one to discover the body.

82
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,210
I'm doing what I can...

83
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,210
I told you not to act on your own!

84
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,510
He's not a threat, though. He's only...

85
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,640
He isn't dangerous, but the person supervising him is.

86
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,540
Didn't you realize that?

87
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,270
You're here because you wanted to realize your dreams, right?

88
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,500
If that's true, don't think about anything else.

89
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,230
I...

90
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,160
I haven't done what you think I did.

91
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,740
I only had a little talk.

92
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,150
Emergency! Attention! All Building No. 18 analysis members, please return to your designated research areas.

93
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,980
I repeat, this is an emergency.

94
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,460
Get out of the way!

95
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,550
What happened?

96
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,380
This is the feed we just received from the reconnaissance team.

97
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,940
Someone, send reinforcements!

98
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,300
Chief, there's something strange about this picture.

99
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,080
The letters are backwards.

100
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,070
I-I don't know what's going on...

101
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,080
Stop it right there.

102
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,000
Rewind.

103
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,080
Right there. Zoom in.

104
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,860
What is... this?

105
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,600
What the hell happened?

106
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,490
Episode Twelve When One Takes Back What Was Lost Within the Wall... (Part Two)

107
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,030
You're not going to conduct another search?

108
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,630
What are you going to do about the meteor fragment?

109
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,860
Nick wasn't able to retrieve it.

110
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,530
As the supervisor of the team, I cannot afford to lose any more of our researchers.

111
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,520
Boss...

112
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,160
Did you retrieve the meteor fragment?

113
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,890
About that...

114
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,170
I'm sure you already know, but this is your last chance.

115
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,450
I can no longer persuade the chief executives, even with my level of influence.

116
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,320
Nick-san.

117
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,970
Hey.

118
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,920
Are you feeling better already?

119
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,900
More or less.

120
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,280
It must have been tough.

121
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,330
I've decided to quit this job.

122
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,640
The chief has already negotiated with PANDORA headquarters.

123
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,100
What are you going to do after you leave?

124
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,920
It's earlier than I had anticipated, but I'm thinking about returning to NASA.

125
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,670
It's only one-fifth of its original size during its prime, but it still technically exists.

126
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,590
The promise of gazing at the stars will have to wait until after I leave this place.

127
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,200
When the time comes, please invite your sister.

128
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,330
Yeah, sure.

129
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,420
Ever since we first met, I never thought of you as a stranger.

130
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,340
It felt like I was seeing a different part of myself.

131
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,320
I'm glad we met.

132
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,060
Is something wrong, Mina?

133
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,170
Why did you resort to such a conspicuous method?

134
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,650
I don't understand...

135
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,920
Why was Nick the only one who made it back alive?

136
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,880
I checked all of the video tapes since that time,

137
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,220
but he doesn't show up at all.

138
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,140
Nick's absent in all of them.

139
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,850
In addition, everyone's shoes were turned over.

140
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,160
This incident wasn't caused by the gate.

141
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,110
It's probably...

142
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,000
his doing.

143
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,900
Yes.

144
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,950
How long have you two been working together?

145
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,940
Did you ever think he was a contractor?

146
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,490
Never.

147
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,910
After meeting you, I'm not so sure anymore.

148
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,920
You're nicer than the others,

149
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,920
so I don't want you to get hurt.

150
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,740
I don't know why I'm acting this way or saying these things.

151
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,520
I never had any other interests aside from research.

152
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,470
Ever since I met you, I...

153
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,780
That's as far as you go.

154
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,760
Is that where the meteor fragment is?

155
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,830
Slowly move backwards and put your hands against the locker.

156
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,430
Damn!

157
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,010
Li-kun!

158
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,770
Why are you here?

159
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,380
You witnessed what I did.

160
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,210
It's only natural to be suspicious,

161
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,980
but I want you to trust me.

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,740
This is the meteor fragment.

163
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,550
I was hired by the CIA.

164
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:38,710
I was ordered to retrieve the material within the gate in exchange for a position in NASA.

165
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,650
I'm not fond of the management here.

166
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,640
Research data is sent to the upper divisions and never disclosed with others.

167
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,660
I don't even know what the other teams are researching.

168
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,500
At this rate, I'll never realize my dreams.

169
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,510
I won't be able to retrieve the real sky or take my sister out to space.

170
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,890
It sounds eccentric, doesn't it?

171
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,780
Unfortunately, it's the truth.

172
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,490
I wanted you to believe in my dreams.

173
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,720
A long time ago, I saw the same thing.

174
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:26,210
Contractors, who became so proficient that they were unable to control their abilities, started killing each other.

175
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,540
Everything you've said up to now was a lie.

176
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,080
This won't bring the real starry sky back.

177
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,850
The dreams you talked about, your sister, everything...

178
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,800
After all, contractors aren't able to dream.

179
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,780
Who are you?

180
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,300
Why doesn't my ability have any effect?

181
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,060
We even have the same abilities.

182
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,350
You and I are nearly identical.

183
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,580
Contractors do not dream...

184
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,100
True, I may have had those thoughts.

185
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,820
That's why I trusted you.

186
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,190
I thought you'd be able to understand my dreams.

187
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,790
In the end, I was the one stupid enough to have trusted you.

188
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,380
Out of everyone, I didn't want to drag you into this.

189
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,170
It can't be...

190
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,330
Li-kun, the stars!

191
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,850
You believed in me after all.

192
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,760
I can't hear you.

193
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,940
Yin...

194
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,020
Go to Gate Eleven in Research Building Three, Hei.

195
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,320
Arrangements have been made for your departure.

196
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,380
You knew about everything, didn't you?

197
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,330
You even knew Nick was the culprit.

198
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,850
Yes, I knew.

199
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,020
In that case, why didn't you take care of him earlier?

200
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,450
I had to see it with my own eyes... the power of the meteor fragment.

201
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,410
What's to become of her?

202
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,390
Her daily life won't change.

203
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,730
She found what she had lost and completed her remuneration.

204
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,420
That's it.

205
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,660
Even Huang said you should rest for a while.

206
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,870
Say...

207
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,670
Do you think the real starry sky will return someday?

208
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,610
You can only retrieve what you lost inside the gate.

209
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,260
Then again, that's probably a rumor, too.

210
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,760
Oh, it's that black cat again!

211
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,430
Shit!

212
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,100
Wait, you stupid cat!

213
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,780
Thanks.

214
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,520
The glow of the moon displays a distant past,

215
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,370
the warmth of youthful days.

216
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,330
That happy feeling in my memories is an intangible mirage.

217
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,230
The melodies resonate against the dull, grey eyes,

218
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,800
but there is no soul to receive them.

219
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,260
Everything has disappeared with the moonlight.

220
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,350
Episode Thirteen A Heart Unswaying on the Water's Surface... (Part One)

221
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,600
Your soul begins to wander.
