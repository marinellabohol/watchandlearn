2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,280
What's with that face, Shihoko?

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,780
This isn't like you.

4
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,730
Hey, what's wrong?

5
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,960
Damn.

6
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,350
Kuno-san?

7
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,240
What are they going to do about that?

8
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,720
What do you mean? They're going to build a wall, that's all.

9
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:06,250
Tokyo is crowded as it is. They're just making life more difficult.

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,320
Whatever we did, we blew it.

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,510
They ditched this place before we were ready to raid it.

12
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,380
What do you think about the rumor saying they were affiliated with the terrorists in South America?

13
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,400
Who knows? That's the reason we came here in the first place.

14
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,420
What is that?

15
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,380
Is something wrong?

16
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,860
A hag, huh?

17
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,440
Do you think she's related to this case?

18
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,740
I'm not sure.

19
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,040
In any case, I'll take it with me and report it to my superior.

20
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,740
"Don't bring useless stuff", huh?

21
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,920
As I thought.

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,340
They didn't even make an effort to investigate it.

23
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,260
It's cold.

24
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,000
Want to go out for a drink?

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,480
Well, I told my wife I'd be home early.

26
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,250
What's with that? You're so stubborn.

27
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,280
That's it!

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,420
Kuno-san, why don't you come over?

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,740
Ah, thanks.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,470
Please make yourself at home.

31
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,340
Oh, don't go out of your way for my sake.

32
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,460
There's nothing fancy about this.

33
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,340
Geez, don't be ridiculous.

34
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,580
You just wanted to show off your pretty wife, didn't you?

35
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,760
You may be right.

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,150
You could at least make an attempt to deny it.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,100
How about you, Kuno-san? It's pretty nice.

38
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,150
Are you trying to pick a fight?

39
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,270
Do you think any woman would be interested in someone with my looks?

40
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,970
That's not true. You're a charming man.

41
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,060
You're a wonderful wife who's too good for a man like him.

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,520
You can handle your share of alcohol, can't you?

43
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,460
It's probably because of my physical build.

44
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,960
There are times when I wish I could get as drunk as a fish.

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:25,240
Police work requires a person who won't carelessly get drunk and disclose important details, right?

46
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,370
I'd feel safer with someone who could handle his booze.

47
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,890
Is that how it is?

48
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,370
You don't get it, Isozaki.

49
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,440
Unlike you,

50
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,950
your wife knows what she's talking about.

51
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,620
My...

52
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,120
Do you want another bottle?

53
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,420
No, I'm drunk.

54
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,890
There you go again.

55
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,380
I'd like to see you actually get drunk for once, Kuno-san.

56
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,410
My body won't let me get drunk.

57
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,390
Isn't that good? You're making an honest living, aren't you?

58
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,330
You're being sarcastic.

59
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,310
Was he also like that?

60
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,310
My husband... Did Isozaki handle alcohol well?

61
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,700
Yeah... I guess so.

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,490
Oh, do you live here?

63
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:33,950
Yes.

64
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,440
Talk about great timing. This must be a sign of Her divine guidance.

65
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,380
Of course! We've come to tell you about something wonderful.

66
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,470
Do you believe in anything?

67
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,580
Um... I don't understand much Japanese.

68
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,710
Nonsense! If you understand that much, it's more than enough.

69
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,060
Where are you from?

70
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,210
Um... I need to bring my things inside.

71
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,380
Let us hold it for you, then.

72
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,850
B-But...

73
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,410
Think nothing of it.

74
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,000
What an admirable young man!

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,830
You actually cook instead of eating pre-packaged food.

76
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,740
Um... Like I said, I need to put this inside the refrigerator.

77
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,440
Shall we cook it for you?

78
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,580
What were you going to make? A kimchi pot dish?

79
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,500
As a Korean, he probably will.

80
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,360
I never said I was Korean...

81
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Oh, my! Are you from China?

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,780
Ni hao!

83
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,810
Good! Kawakami-san, hand him a pamphlet.

84
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,300
That's right! There happens to be a Chinese edition.

85
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,260
See?

86
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,680
Isn't she beautiful? She's the guru.

87
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,980
You're a lucky one. This was certainly the guidance of Gate-sama.

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,650
Gate?

89
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,950
Are you interested in Gate-sama?

90
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:47,170
Really? You must listen to what we have to say.

91
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,110
We worship Gate-sama, who is an embodiment of our faith.

92
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,620
Have you heard about the Fellowship of the Gate Fundamentalists, also known as...

93
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,670
In this world where the moon has vanished and the stars have changed,

94
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,980
we must not be frightened or intimidated. Let us pray instead.

95
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,300
The Brotherhood of the Gate?

96
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,430
It's one of those new cults.

97
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,010
It's a recent fad.

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,930
Have you ever heard about them?

99
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,640
Yeah.

100
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,870
You're to infiltrate the cult and kill the star of Arma, their guru.

101
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,090
Those are your orders.

102
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,820
Fortunately, there'll be an initiation for non-members next week.

103
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,240
The woman in the picture is the undercover source.

104
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,950
You're to work with her.

105
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,240
Shihoko, you were a part of the syndicate after all.

106
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,370
Hey! Let go! Hey!

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,920
What's with you?

108
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,740
Don't make a scene. If you're going to pick somebody's pocket, choose your targets wisely.

109
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,630
I'm not some pigeon, you know.

110
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,880
Ow!

111
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,770
Hey!

112
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,830
Anything else?

113
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,770
Is there anything else you need?

114
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,970
I told you I'm fine.

115
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,950
I see.

116
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,910
You're...

117
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,990
a nice person.

118
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,850
I don't really have a choice, do I?

119
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,970
I'm sort of responsible for what happened.

120
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,000
Sort of? You accused me of being a thief.

121
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,170
There's no way I made a mistake about that.

122
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,590
I didn't take your wallet, did I?

123
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,480
I guess not.

124
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,610
What do you mean by that?

125
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,580
I understand the position you're in. That's why I settled the details of the accident out of court.

126
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,770
Besides, I missed my audition because of that incident.

127
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,240
You've caused me a lot of trouble.

128
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,750
Audition?

129
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,360
It was for a play.

130
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,600
I see.

131
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,060
I only had a one-in-a-million shot, though.

132
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,970
Not that I care. When I get released from here, you're going to make up for it.

133
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,980
Why are you so quiet?

134
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,940
Don't worry. The penalty won't be anything excessive.

135
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,650
You know...

136
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,980
I'm surprised by how many changes in expressions you make.

137
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,990
Does that come from your acting background?

138
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,590
What's so funny?

139
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,680
You're no fun!

140
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,100
Why aren't you drunk after drinking that much?

141
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,240
I told you I can't get drunk.

142
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,300
That's no fun, Kiyopii!

143
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,440
Come on.

144
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,180
Stop calling me that.

145
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,870
Your name's Kiyoshi. What's wrong with calling you Kiyopii?

146
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,840
Geez, give me a break.

147
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,610
Hey, where are you going? Your house is this way.

148
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,050
You crazy drunk.

149
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,000
It's not because I'm drunk,

150
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,050
even though I'm pretty buzzed.

151
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,760
Which is it?

152
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,270
It's obvious I did it because I like you.

153
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,270
Don't joke around with me.

154
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,770
How could you like me? You hardly know who I am.

155
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,190
It's not an issue about knowing more about you.

156
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,120
Good things can come out of not knowing too much.

157
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,600
Right?

158
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,830
There's a limit to how much you can hide.

159
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,190
Right, Shihoko?

160
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,610
Episode Nineteen Dreaming Shallow, Uninebriated... (Part One)

161
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:28,420
When the wild spirit descends upon this land,

162
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,850
misery of colossal proportions will accompany it.

163
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:42,020
Gate-sama is not the wall built by the efforts of the lecherous,

164
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,330
but the pristine spirit hidden within it.

165
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,450
That ray will light the world.

166
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:57,090
The guru makes an appearance before her apostles during an event that only occurs once a year.

167
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,090
It'll be difficult to locate her.

168
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,930
What about the woman?

169
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,290
She's scheduled to instruct the initiates tomorrow.

170
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,250
Roger.

171
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,070
Huang,

172
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,690
reporting periodically will be difficult. Leave everything to me.

173
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,710
Why do you want to be constantly updated anyway?

174
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,720
Is there something you're worried about?

175
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,050
It's nothing. Understood.

176
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,980
The guru continued to witness the impending misery for days.

177
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,130
One day, She had attained enlightenment.

178
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,530
Very good.

179
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,240
We'll move on to page 201, The Dark Gospel.

180
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,430
Sir.

181
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,410
Yes?

182
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,860
Please read it.

183
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,620
Sanctification Room, 1:00 am

184
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,030
The Dark Gospel, verse seven.

185
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,930
The moon was spirited away. On this night, misery descended upon the sacred land.

186
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,340
The moon disappeared, and the stellar constellation was renewed.

187
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,350
Do you know what this means?

188
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,330
Sit down. Everything's fine.

189
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,610
This room is the equivalent of a confessional.

190
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,620
Respect of privacy is the rule of thumb here.

191
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,320
I've already inspected the room anyway.

192
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,220
Underneath the main chamber lies a secret area that only the guru and her trusted apostles know about.

193
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,750
You'll be able to find the entry route with that.

194
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,280
The guru will be meeting an important person on the day after tomorrow at 2 A.M.

195
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,230
What'll happen at that time?

196
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,730
I'll deal with the guru.

197
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,980
However, since I can't use my power repeatedly,

198
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,670
you'll have to take care of the others.

199
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,490
We cannot afford to fail.

200
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,900
It took me three years to get this far.

201
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,910
Why?

202
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,160
It was necessary to gain the trust of the cult,

203
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,920
as well as identify the guru.

204
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,080
Identify?

205
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,360
Does she have a body double?

206
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,020
Yes, but that's not all.

207
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,680
I'm sure you've been informed that the guru is a contractor,

208
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,270
but were you told about her ability?

209
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,180
No.

210
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,560
Do you remember the incident that occurred six years ago, when a politician named Hirose was assassinated?

211
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,420
He was killed by his female secretary. There were witnesses who saw her in the act.

212
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,300
The politician had connections with the syndicate.

213
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,850
He had taken initial steps in an attempt to disband the cult.

214
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,920
What the syndicate learned through a subsequent investigation

215
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:34,610
was that the person who killed him wasn't his secretary, but her look-alike.

216
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,730
They weren't twins, were they?

217
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,210
The punch line's even worse than that.

218
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,050
The murderer transformed into the secretary and murdered Hirose.

219
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,460
That is the ability of Arma the guru.

220
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,720
Transformation.

221
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,180
Please come again.

222
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,020
Are you closing soon?

223
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,750
Take your time.

224
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,730
I'm glad you come to visit on his memorial day every year.

225
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,530
During the afternoon, a relative of his stopped by and talked about Isozaki.

226
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,930
Our conversation didn't last very long, and I felt vexed by it.

227
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,110
Didn't you tell me these kinds of things happen frequently?

228
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,130
When a family member is killed, you lose your memory out of shock.

229
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,590
You said it happened all the time.

230
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,680
Yeah, I might have.

231
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,770
Could that be true? Was I that distant from him?

232
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,330
What are you talking about?

233
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,750
I even have faint memories of you, Kuno-san.

234
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,250
The man I lived with for two years, however...

235
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't remember him at all.

236
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,790
You can't do anything about what you've forgotten.

237
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,220
Some things are better left that way.

238
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,080
It's okay. I know how to get to the station.

239
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,930
It's the third time. I won't get lost this time.

240
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,700
I need to get some fresh air anyway.

241
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,600
Geez.

242
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,070
Take care.

243
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,050
Shihoko?

244
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,610
Is she an acquaintance of yours?

245
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,040
Kuno-san?

246
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,980
What are you doing here?

247
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,900
Hey! What's wrong?

248
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,460
Isozaki!

249
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,380
Darling?

250
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,660
Dear! What's wrong?

251
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,720
Honey! Get a hold of yourself!

252
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,260
Shi... zu... ka...

253
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,830
Honey!

254
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,050
Isozaki!

255
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,670
Wait, Shihoko!

256
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,410
Isozaki!

257
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,790
Isozaki!

258
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,270
Isozaki!

259
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,000
Isozaki!

260
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,540
The case was closed?

261
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,290
Letter of
resignation

262
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,270
Investigations have been concluded?

263
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,810
Due to the abnormal nature of the crime,

264
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,300
it was categorized with the other special cases that have been occurring recently.

265
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,090
Special cases?

266
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,030
I'm sure you've heard about it.

267
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,910
Those with supernatural powers, referred to as contractors, have been at large.

268
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,560
Isn't that just a rumor?

269
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,330
At the gate during the turmoil in South America,

270
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,290
there were stories about the same kinds of people being involved.

271
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,210
This is the autopsy report on Isozaki.

272
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,170
He died from complications resulting from deterioration of his internal organs.

273
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,350
Although we know what took place, we still don't know how it happened.

274
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,060
We're not prepared to deal with these kinds of cases at this moment in time.

275
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,880
That is all I can tell you right now.

276
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,980
I don't know why you submitted this,

277
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,710
but this case has been dealt with internally.

278
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,030
There's no reason for you to resign. That's what I wanted to tell you.

279
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,400
Shihoko, what exactly are you?

280
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,010
Kuno-san?

281
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,960
Who are you?

282
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:18,320
Did you know that it's standard procedure to erase the memories of those who have witnessed a contractor?

283
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,750
You saw her when Isozaki-san was killed, didn't you?

284
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,790
That's why your memories will be erased in due time.

285
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,510
There are some people who have voiced regrets about this,

286
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,840
citing your proficiency as an intelligence officer who could be of some use to us.

287
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,550
Who the hell are you?

288
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,760
Parts of Mrs. Isozaki's memories have already been erased.

289
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,630
What?

290
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,190
Won't you consider joining the syndicate?

291
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,500
It's the only way you'll be able to prevent the erasure of your memories.

292
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,820
Oh, my. It's starting to rain.

293
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,160
I would commend you on assembling this many,

294
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,280
but it's not enough.

295
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,210
It's not that easy.

296
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,920
It doesn't look like you can handle it.

297
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,070
Arma the guru better be available today.

298
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,240
She's waiting in another room.

299
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,200
I'm drenched.

300
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,660
That man... He was there with Amber.

301
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,400
How are the preparations going?

302
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,380
It's ready.

303
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,770
What an unenthusiastic reply.

304
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,410
Don't treat dolls like tools.

305
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,780
Is this in accordance with Amber's wishes?

306
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,830
It's for the sake of E.P.R.

307
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,920
Kishida, was it?

308
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,390
It looks like you're able to see observer apparitions.

309
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,840
Are you a contractor?

310
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,520
What?

311
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,310
Who sent you?

312
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,570
Turn on the lights!

313
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,180
Guru!

314
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,610
Are you the contractor who was sent to kill me?

315
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,580
Go ahead. Do as you please.

316
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,920
Damn, he shouldn't be too far away.

317
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,980
Find him!

318
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,930
Sir!

319
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,190
You blew it? How?

320
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,360
Did you order Yin to send an observer apparition?

321
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,120
Yeah. I was worried about the situation.

322
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,700
Why did you do something like that? That isn't like you at all.

323
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,010
The woman... What happened to the undercover agent?

324
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,730
She was caught, no thanks to you.

325
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,200
Did you hear what I said, Huang?

326
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,280
Huang!

327
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,540
A friend who was erased, a memory likewise erased.
