2
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,940
So that's what it was. I've solved it! I've solved it!

3
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,560
I must be really tired.

4
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,010
I need to take a break after I finish this.

5
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,980
What is it? Is the analysis finished?

6
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,380
No, sir. Dr. Schroeder's been...

7
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,660
Hold it right there!

8
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,350
Stop!

9
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,860
Shit! The suspect's heading toward Meiji-dori Avenue.

10
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,070
They sure are making us work hard from the start of the day.

11
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,620
Good work.

12
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,590
Boss...

13
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,640
They were instructed to target the U.S. embassy.

14
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,930
Is it them?

15
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,470
E.P.R., the group of contractors responsible for the terrorist attacks.

16
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,050
The man we arrested confessed to being a member.

17
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,320
Did he have any information about the leader?

18
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,610
He's being interrogated about it as we speak.

19
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,230
We might not learn anything at all, though.

20
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,520
There were signs of his memory being altered.

21
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,410
According to their previous statement,

22
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,920
the objective of the E.P.R. is to attain public recognition and acquire greater rights.

23
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,590
Aside from their methods of achieving those goals, I don't have a problem understanding that ideal.

24
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:29,360
However, all of the suspects in question are unable to remember one specific memory,

25
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,420
as well as any information about the leader.

26
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,940
What are you implying?

27
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,330
I have a strange feeling

28
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:44,850
that a different person who wasn't involved in previous cases is who we're after.

29
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,260
I see. How troublesome.

30
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:55,320
In any case, we must immediately persuade the U.S. embassy to raise their terror alert level.

31
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,260
You're to go directly to the embassy and meet with the Chief of Security, Harris Bonham,

32
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,590
and deliberate on their intended course of action.

33
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,780
Understood. Excuse me.

34
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,350
It's me.

35
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,370
Public Safety Division
Foreign Affairs Department 4

36
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,380
This was the report made by the Department of Astronomy.

37
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,860
After analyzing the three suspects and the celestial data,

38
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:25,080
it was concluded that they weren't responsible for the eleven detections that were made two days ago.

39
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,610
Do you think the serial bombings had any influence on contractor-related activity?

40
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,020
These numbers are astronomically high in comparison to the past few years.

41
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,570
It's probably due to the effects of the solar maximum and the Gulfind wavelength.

42
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,580
You meant to say Gulhinde, Matsumoto-san.

43
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,420
It's Gullfinger, morons.

44
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,280
Is something on your mind?

45
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,640
No, it's nothing.

46
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,190
In any case, three more days... Three more days until the end of the solar maximum.

47
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,530
If everything goes as scheduled, contractor-related incidents should start to subside.

48
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,060
Stay alert until then.

49
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,720
Roger!

50
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,380
Strange incidents have been occurring recently, haven't they?

51
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,700
I think it's related to the solar maximum,

52
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,770
as well as the existence of the rumored supernatural...

53
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,250
The government, police, or...

54
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,150
Supernatural, huh? I'd like to be one. Don't you?

55
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,280
Not really.

56
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,630
They can probably move things around without using their hands.

57
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,280
I bet it's really convenient.

58
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,580
Whenever it gets busy around here, I'd be able to stay behind the counter and do the dishes at the same time!

59
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,710
I bet you think it never gets busy in here.

60
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,560
N-No...

61
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,770
Thanks for the meal.

62
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,740
You're welcome.

63
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,830
Waiting for your food?

64
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,860
Don't be ridiculous.

65
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,660
I was waiting for you.

66
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,990
It's time for work.

67
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,850
American Embassy

68
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,380
The security here is flawless.

69
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,560
Ever since the bombing incidents occurred, we've increased the number of security guards

70
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,240
and sent the ambassador back to our homeland as a precautionary measure.

71
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,890
Five out of ten cases occurred on extraterritorial soil, though.

72
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,350
In other words, you're telling us that our security outside the embassy is insufficient,

73
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,080
which is why you want to deploy officers inside?

74
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,120
Out of the question.

75
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,630
If you want us to take action, pressure your own government into doing so first.

76
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,790
If they can negotiate with the U.S. government and receive permission,

77
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,990
we'll welcome you with open arms.

78
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,870
As long as permission is granted, of course.

79
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,770
They don't trust us at all.

80
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,050
This isn't the first time they've treated us like this.

81
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,890
What are we supposed to do?

82
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,340
Hey, it's him!

83
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,800
How are your injuries?

84
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,000
I feel as great as I look.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,420
That's good to hear.

86
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,960
By the way, what are you doing here?

87
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,330
I received information that the attacks would continue.

88
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,950
You were hurt in the line of duty,

89
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,940
so I understand why you can't ignore the situation. Leave the rest to us.

90
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,970
I just wanted to get a good view of the explosion.

91
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,810
Just kidding.

92
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,360
Actually, I received some additional embassy-related information.

93
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,380
I wanted to let you in on a secret

94
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,490
as a token of my appreciation for the other day.

95
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,930
What's it about?

96
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,880
Do you happen to know a scientist by the name of Robert Schroeder, Misaki?

97
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,640
He researched gate-related information, if I recall.

98
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,290
He became famous for solving some mystery.

99
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,110
I haven't heard about him lately.

100
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,020
He was actually quarantined deep within PANDORA until just recently.

101
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,530
Why?

102
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,050
The E.P.R. was after him.

103
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,620
I don't know why.

104
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,040
Despite PANDORA's efforts, he was abducted the night before yesterday.

105
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,910
Are you implying that the U.S. embassy was involved?

106
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,290
I wouldn't go that far.

107
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,360
A doll was assigned to monitor him since he was still an important figure.

108
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,850
However, the location where the observer apparition disappeared was...

109
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,420
I don't believe it.

110
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,430
I didn't expect you to.

111
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:42,290
The possibility of E.P.R. members masquerading within the U.S. embassy can't be discarded.

112
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,570
I'm sure you already know, but February, the leader of the E.P.R.,

113
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,310
used to work by my side as a fellow agent.

114
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,020
Isn't that still true?

115
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,550
What do you think?

116
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,400
Oh, sorry. I couldn't restrain myself at the sight of that wrinkle.

117
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,840
Misaki.

118
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,130
What is it?

119
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,520
From here on out, the line that separates enemies from allies doesn't exist.

120
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,290
You must act on your own intuition.

121
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,520
I'll see you later.

122
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,780
The Japanese officers finally left.

123
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,480
What was that all about?

124
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,990
They said that the terrorists responsible for the previous attacks are targeting us.

125
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,980
I see. What else?

126
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,930
That's it. They didn't have any evidence to back their claim.

127
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:04,420
Did they think we'd cooperate and risk compromising federal secrets over an intuition?

128
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,630
Doesn't that sound dangerous, though?

129
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,800
Isn't that group responsible for the attacks made against the CIA?

130
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,630
There's no need to worry. I'm the head of security. Everything has been accounted for.

131
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,530
Are you scared?

132
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,660
I'll help you forget about it, like always.

133
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,410
Brita?

134
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,340
I'm going to deliver these important documents before you help me forget about it.

135
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,340
Brita,

136
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,690
I'll be waiting for you, honey.

137
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,170
It looks like we've finally found the real Dr. Schroeder.

138
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,900
Intelligence is on the move.

139
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,940
They're saying that the E.P.R. is targeting this place.

140
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,410
I haven't heard Amber talk about any attacks on the embassy.

141
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,970
Neither have I.

142
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,680
The syndicate might have spread that rumor themselves so they could infiltrate the premises.

143
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,830
More than likely.

144
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,770
With the assistance of an accelerator, anti-gate particles tend to gather centripetally

145
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,910
in order to alter the stability of the gate.

146
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,870
The possibility of his memories being implanted onto the body double can't be ruled out.

147
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,310
However, there's no doubt that the information was extracted from him.

148
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,760
I think it'd be worthwhile to arrange a meeting with her.

149
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,690
Let's be a little more patient.

150
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,300
If he's the real professor, they'll do just about anything to infiltrate the grounds.

151
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,190
If that's what Amber wants.

152
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,730
Episode Twenty-One City Under Crackdown, Moist with Tears... (Part One)

153
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,830
There are more cops than usual.

154
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,460
Here, too.

155
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,460
Can you make it?

156
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,740
Not a problem.

157
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,610
I'll leave the timing to you.

158
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,550
Are you ready?

159
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,760
Whenever you are.

160
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,870
I'm only a decoy. You're the one who has to bomb the embassy.

161
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,630
Let's go.

162
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,820
Saitou-san, what is this?

163
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,100
Anpan and milk is the meal of choice when it comes to undercover work, you know.

164
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,230
I've never heard that before. You have bad taste.

165
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,250
You don't have to eat it if you don't want to! Boss, here's your share.

166
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,290
Give me another one.

167
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,450
O-Okay.

168
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,010
Do they even sell milk from a bottle these days?

169
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,860
Don't you know that glass bottles are the best type of container for the environment?

170
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,570
Recycle, man! Recycle!

171
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:00,940
He's here!

172
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,760
Shit!

173
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,250
I'm in.

174
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,000
Good. Yin...

175
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,910
Move forward twenty meters.

176
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,190
There are two guards at the front entrance.

177
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,800
Head to your right.

178
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,260
Follow the road at the next turn.

179
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,010
The first window is unlocked.

180
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,230
Wait.

181
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,140
Okay, they're gone.

182
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,430
Five minutes until detonation.

183
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,260
Got it. Get out of there.

184
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,760
Who's there?

185
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,860
I didn't think we would meet again so soon.

186
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,700
I'm glad I chose Amber.

187
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,250
As I said earlier, there's no need for concern.

188
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,790
It's probably a prank.

189
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,170
Besides, the smoke screen landed within your jurisdiction. It doesn't have anything to do with us.

190
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,310
That was obviously a decoy!

191
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,560
Even as we speak, security within the embassy's grounds already has its hands full and...

192
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,440
Don't test my patience.

193
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,590
Call the Fire Defense Agency!

194
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,240
Sir!

195
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,710
T-This must be an accident! There must be some kind of mistake...

196
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,130
Mr. Bonham!

197
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,390
Don't let them in!

198
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,650
Yes?

199
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,800
This is Kirihara.

200
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,970
They beat us. I'm sorry.

201
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,600
How are things at the embassy?

202
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,340
I can't confirm anything without setting foot on the premises.

203
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,770
Manager, I need to ask you for a favor.

204
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,170
On the grounds of preserving public order, please grant us permission to enter the embassy.

205
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:42,960
What?

206
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,360
At this rate, we won't be able to rescue the survivors, and we'll lose our lead on the suspects!

207
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,240
Understood. Give me five minutes.

208
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,240
It's just as you heard.

209
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,540
Do you have the permission of the Chief Cabinet Secretary?

210
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,560
Yes, as long as foreign relations with the U.S. are not compromised in the process.

211
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,140
From a diplomatic perspective, you have a justifiable case.

212
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,630
I can address the details to a friend in the U.S. in order to ward off the hawks.

213
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,800
In that case...

214
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,400
Yes, we'll move onto the next scenario.

215
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:22,180
Transport the wounded to the paramedics at once!

216
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,000
Why are people so self-absorbed in these kinds of situations?

217
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,400
What's he trying to do?

218
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,800
Damn.

219
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,690
Orders to abandon the professor and engage in a fight weren't issued, if I recall.

220
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,880
Is that him?

221
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,350
The man Amber has coveted after.

222
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,630
It is, unfortunately.

223
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,000
All the more reason to call a truce, if that's the case.

224
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,850
See you later, Black Grim Reaper.

225
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,810
You're the one who abducted the professor after all.

226
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,380
It's been a while, November 11.

227
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,970
I'd like to meet February.

228
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,850
Of course.

229
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,520
She would like to meet you as well.

230
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,690
Drop the gun and place your hands behind your head!

231
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,410
I'm Lieutenant Kirihara from the Intelligence Department, Division of Foreign Affairs, Section Four.

232
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,780
Who are you people?

233
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,340
We're from PANDORA.

234
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,590
PANDORA?

235
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,330
Don't move!

236
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,500
Don't move!

237
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,720
Hei's late.

238
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,430
Can you talk, kitty cat?

239
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,340
The strange, white-haired man talked about the principles of the world

240
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,630
to the strange people who were around him.

241
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,010
People dressed as beasts,

242
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,380
people who predicted the future,

243
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,840
people who received the death sentence.

244
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,680
Fate is an inevitability,

245
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,260
but resisting it is one way of life.

246
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Episode Twenty-Two City Under Crackdown, Moist with Tears... (Part Two)

247
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,460
The purple haze lingers.
