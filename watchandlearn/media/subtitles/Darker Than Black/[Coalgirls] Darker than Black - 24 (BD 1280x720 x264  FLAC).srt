2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,720
I think I'll go to the countryside and fish all day.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,820
Fish?

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,110
I used to do that a lot. Crucians were my game of choice.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,740
Well, you do look like a crucian carp.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,640
Shut up.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,990
It's easy to lose track of time just from watching the flow of the water.

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:26,030
After all, our lives are like leaves flowing down a stream.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,750
Hey, I was in the middle of a good soliloquy.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,810
Oh, sorry.

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,050
What's this? Are you going to light it for me?

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,770
What the hell are you doing?

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,480
Smoking isn't good for you.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,110
You should watch how much you eat, too.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,230
H-Hey...

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,110
See you around.

17
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,080
The target is heading east on Koshu Boulevard.

18
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,140
He saw us. Apprehend him at once!

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,560
You better keep following me.

20
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,960
At last, it's about to begin.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,090
The beginning, the beginning... the beginning of the end.

22
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,730
I'm Kirihara from the Fourth Section of External Affairs, Division of Intelligence.

23
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,240
I'd like to speak with Dr. Robert Schroeder.

24
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,250
Do you have an appointment?

25
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,350
No, I don't.

26
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,440
Please wait here.

27
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,990
He'll see you now.

28
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,820
That, too?

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,400
Security precautions.

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,350
Excuse me.

31
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,860
Welcome, Lieutenant Kirihara.

32
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,990
I thought I requested a meeting with Dr. Schroeder.

33
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,120
I'd prefer if we were alone,

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,520
but he really wanted to come along.

35
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,210
I've always wanted to speak with you.

36
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,240
Unfortunately, we're short on time. Let me give you a quick explanation.

37
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,200
Please have a seat.

38
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,380
Due to the emergence of the neutral territory in South America five years ago,

39
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,850
mankind lost a means of accessing Heaven's Gate

40
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,730
as well as a vast area of land and millions of its inhabitants.

41
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,260
The one responsible for this was BK201.

42
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,260
Why did he cause that tragedy?

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,130
He? You're mistaken.

44
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,730
At that time, Messier Code BK201 was designated to another woman.

45
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,570
What did you say?

46
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,620
Let's try to stick with the facts of the present instead of details from the past.

47
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,220
The E.P.R. is attempting to repeat the South American phenomenon here in Tokyo.

48
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,370
Where did you get that information?

49
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,580
We've been fighting them ever since that incident.

50
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,350
It'd be difficult not to know.

51
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,830
It's what we refer to as the "Tokyo Explosion".

52
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,160
If an explosion of the same magnitude as that of South America occurs here,

53
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,510
the entire nation of Japan will become nothing more than neutral territory.

54
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,780
Everything in existence will vanish into thin air.

55
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,550
Rest assured. We won't let something like that happen.

56
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,180
How do you plan to prevent it?

57
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,000
All we have to do is destroy Hell's Gate.

58
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,890
Is that even possible?

59
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,640
Of course. The wall that surrounds Hell's Gate wasn't constructed just to ward off trespassers.

60
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,720
It was put in place to protect something, much like a sturdy fortress.

61
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,570
That's...

62
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,730
The Saturn System.

63
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,260
I hope the boss isn't getting herself into trouble.

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,040
I have faith in our boss!

65
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,640
Yeah, right. You've been following her all day.

66
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,720
Yes? Oh, Matsumoto-san.

67
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,760
Yes, I'm with Kouno.

68
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,010
Yes.

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,790
What did you say?

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,080
Kouno, we're going to PANDORA!

71
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,810
Why?

72
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,810
The boss is down there!

73
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,060
I'll leave the money here!

74
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,310
Sure, thanks!

75
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,360
Shit. What the hell is going on?

76
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,250
On the forty-fifth day of the solar maximum,

77
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,400
the gate will reach its final stage and its maximum capacity.

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,540
It will maintain this state for about thirty minutes.

79
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:22,050
If the cultured, accelerated anti-gate particles are released into the core by the Saturn Ring during that period of time,

80
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,050
the gate will disappear.

81
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:31,610
Just to let you know, BK201 can only initiate the Tokyo Explosion during the final stage.

82
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,010
It's one of the invaluable pieces of information we acquired from South America.

83
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:44,900
Intriguing, isn't it? Warfare between humans and contractors first began within this thirty minute time frame.

84
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,780
Five hours and twenty-seven minutes until the moment of truth.

85
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,410
What is it?

86
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,250
Special forces have engaged in combat at Honcho 2-chome, Kita Ward.

87
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,540
Understood.

88
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,070
Oh, it's already begun!

89
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,960
This is...

90
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,670
Restless stars,

91
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:27,440
shimmering, crying, falling from the sky...

92
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,030
We've detected numerous contractor-related responses within the Kita and Itabashi Wards.

93
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,460
Numerous isn't specific enough. Give me an actual number.

94
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,660
Well, there are multitudes of them.

95
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,600
What?

96
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,410
What's going on?

97
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,640
Not only has the data from the Division of Astronomy been leaked,

98
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,740
it's being accessed in real time.

99
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,420
I see. I've heard about it.

100
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,050
Something about the unofficial existence of a subway.

101
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,250
Due to the turmoil resulting from the emergence of the gate,

102
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,310
every document related to this subway was lost.

103
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,530
It isn't even under surveillance now.

104
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,970
Hey, do we really have to walk?

105
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,060
There's no electricity in here.

106
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,540
On the other hand, the police's observer apparitions can't access it, either.

107
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,570
Yin.

108
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,790
Geez.

109
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,160
It's no use. Intelligence or not, they won't let us in.

110
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,290
I see.

111
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,820
Saitou-san, isn't it better if we return to headquarters?

112
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,790
It's a contractor-related matter, no matter how you look at it.

113
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,210
We're to stay here.

114
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,030
I just received a call with those instructions.

115
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,330
We've been ordered to stand back.

116
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,180
If we return to headquarters, we won't be allowed to leave the room.

117
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,710
What's the meaning of this?

118
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,630
How should I know? We received idiotic orders at an important time.

119
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,960
What the hell are our superiors thinking?

120
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,480
The stars that are shining and shimmering,

121
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,270
glistening between the bands of space,

122
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,770
where are you going?

123
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,180
A dark hole no one knows about.

124
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,280
It looks like it's begun.

125
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
Yes.

126
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,650
Everything is going according to schedule.

127
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,080
Amber...

128
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,900
Would you like some eggs?

129
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,150
Sure.

130
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,580
This is right beneath the wall, isn't it?

131
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,860
It doesn't look like we'll be able to pass through easily.

132
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,100
What are you going to do?

133
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,700
This is what I'll do.

134
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,460
What's the meaning of this?

135
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,400
I promised Amber I'd guide you here,

136
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,610
as long as I was able to do that I could do whatever I wanted after that.

137
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:45,940
I joined Amber just to fight you again.

138
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,900
I knew we'd cross paths if I joined the E.P.R.

139
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,080
Ever since I received this ability, losing to another contractor was an inconceivable thought.

140
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,490
Do you understand how humiliated I felt?

141
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,660
No.

142
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,190
I expected as much.

143
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,490
Did he say humiliated? That's an interesting way for a contractor to put it.

144
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Episode Twenty-Four

145
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Meteor Shower...

146
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,950
Hell's Gate and Heaven's Gate are inverses of each other, making both integral existences.

147
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,110
If you close one, the other will vanish.

148
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,810
What will happen to the contractors once the gate is gone?

149
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,190
They will all melt and disappear,

150
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,790
just like this sugar.

151
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,170
It can't be... Is that true?

152
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,040
It is. I've experimented with it myself.

153
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,170
That's outrageous! Who do you think you are?

154
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,390
They may be contractors, but they're also human beings!

155
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,940
Not all of them are criminals!

156
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,600
In that case, would it be acceptable to sacrifice millions of people for the sake of several thousand contractors?

157
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,560
It's easy to support humanism,

158
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,390
but to disregard reality and endanger the lives of people

159
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,560
is an unacceptable decision as far as the police is concerned. Don't you agree, Kirihara?

160
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,940
Manager...

161
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,570
I apologize for my subordinate's behavior, Mr. Nishijima.

162
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,720
No, we had an enjoyable conversation.

163
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,600
I'll leave the rest to you. I need to make preparations for the final stage.

164
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,570
See you later, young lady.

165
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,100
The decision to activate the Saturn Ring was a difficult one to make.

166
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,460
You were on their side the whole time, weren't you?

167
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,930
PANDORA is merely a research facility regulated by the United Nations.

168
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,010
They aren't authorized to conduct an operation involving the lives of millions at their own discretion.

169
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,080
Whatever's taking place here is clearly an abuse of authority, a felony.

170
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,460
Unless a force of colossal proportions is at work,

171
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,400
one that transcends the framework of a nation,

172
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,790
a decision of this magnitude couldn't have been kept a secret.

173
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,090
November 11 was looking for a syndicate with astronomical power.

174
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,330
You may not have realized it,

175
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,790
but you've been working for the syndicate all along.

176
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,220
Me? Absurd!

177
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:37,000
Intelligence agencies, governments, and authorities from all over the world are under the influence of the syndicate

178
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,380
and used to maintain world order.

179
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,510
BK201, too?

180
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,000
BK201. Code name: Hei.

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,900
He's also a member of the syndicate.

182
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,760
He's in hiding at the moment, though.

183
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,640
Hiding?

184
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,840
Why bother telling me the truth now?

185
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,340
You could have dealt with me as you did with November.

186
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,650
Killing you wouldn't be difficult at all.

187
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,810
However, we're always in need of people with talent,

188
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,390
such as yourself.

189
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,600
What's so funny?

190
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,190
It's come to this, as I thought.

191
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,870
What do you mean?

192
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,150
If I could have killed you,

193
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,710
she wouldn't have let me guide you in the first place.

194
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,300
Are you saying you never expected to win from the start?

195
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,370
I couldn't resist an opportunity to fight you, even if I already knew the outcome.

196
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,270
What an irrational decision, inappropriate of a contractor.

197
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,740
It's all your fault.

198
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
It's because I met you.

199
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,800
You're a strange one, too.

200
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,590
Go, BK201.

201
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,000
Sorry, you've only caught an old man.

202
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,480
Wait.

203
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,710
Don't do that in a place like this.

204
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,590
I can't help it. It's my remuneration.

205
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,940
I'm fine as I am.

206
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,810
I have a problem with that.

207
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,960
This is it.

208
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,850
This is what the old man was working on, huh?

209
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,350
As long as we destroy this...

210
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,450
Amber, huh?

211
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,970
Is something wrong?

212
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,340
No.

213
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,850
This is what the old man was working on, huh?

214
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,890
Let's hurry.

215
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,170
Good, the ring's been destroyed.

216
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,100
The anti-gate particle convergence unit has stopped!

217
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,520
What did you say?

218
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,250
What are you going to do about this? I risked everything in order to create that masterpiece!

219
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,240
Brita!

220
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,250
How's the ring?

221
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,740
It's been taken care of.

222
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,720
How are things?

223
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,470
Nearly every member who participated in the attack is dead.

224
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,010
Those who survived are trying to get away.

225
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,330
I see.

226
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,460
What about Amagiri?

227
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,870
What's going on?

228
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,010
The gate... Could it be within that wall?

229
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,360
There's a new anti-gate particle response.

230
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,850
The Saturn Ring is still functional.

231
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,890
It looks like we weren't the only ones who were trying to deceive our opponents.

232
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,350
Our hope now rests with Amber and these children.

233
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,070
I wasn't informed about that!

234
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,780
Yes, this would be the first time you've heard about it.

235
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,400
The destroyed ring was only a decoy.

236
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,180
The existence of a backup was never disclosed.

237
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:25,010
I see. There wasn't a backup of the Jupiter Ring to prevent that accident from happening in South America.

238
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,560
Marvelous! You're marvelous!

239
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,640
This is what the inside of the gate looks like, huh?

240
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,030
Observer apparition?

241
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,590
It's calling.

242
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,900
Wait, Yin! Don't move around so carelessly.

243
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,800
This way.

244
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,590
Yin!

245
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,530
H-Hey!

246
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,710
Well, here goes nothing!

247
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:03,810
What's this?

248
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,810
What's going on?

249
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,460
This is the gate, huh? Interesting, isn't it?

250
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,430
Quickly traverse the banks of Styx.

251
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,770
Do not lose your way, stars.

252
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,450
Do not lose sight of your leader.

253
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,960
There's an enormous amount of static interference.

254
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,700
Static interference?

255
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,440
The source is somewhere outside. Its level of power is equivalent to ours.

256
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,040
A certain system is activating the observer apparitions.

257
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,510
I see. They're using the dolls.

258
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,540
Ouch!

259
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,000
What's wrong?

260
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,010
I accessed PANDORA's server and was looking through some old files,

261
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,550
but they cut me off.

262
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,290
I did find something interesting.

263
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,560
Any medium used by a single doll

264
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,260
will transmit an immense amount of pain upon accessing the deepest part of the gate.

265
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:11,810
However, if a legion of dolls is linked and their abilities are enhanced with the meteor fragment,

266
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:17,990
it is theoretically possible for their observer apparitions to enter the gate's core without harming them.

267
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,150
The attack on the ring was a diversion after all.

268
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,560
BK201 has already entered the premises.

269
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,340
If we trace the source of this static...

270
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,010
I don't like dry food.

271
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,890
It was fun working with you guys.

272
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,250
Mao...

273
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:50,280
One day, if a cat who looks just like me visits you...

274
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,720
The lives that those stars represent will fade

275
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,290
until every last one of them falls and disappears.

276
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,970
Where are you going, fallen star?

277
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,440
Don't go without me.

278
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,870
Now they've lost their means of access.

279
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:33,080
They can't enter the core or leave the gate.

280
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,580
It's our victory.

281
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,210
Humans were born to err.

282
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,840
There's no justice that serves all.

283
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,270
Sacrifices must be made in order to determine the course of action with the lowest possibility of error.

284
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,850
I'm willing to stain my hands for that purpose.

285
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,550
Kirihara, grow up.

286
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,050
In the dark skies where nobody resides

287
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,490
lies a large hole

288
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,640
beyond the glow...

289
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,040
It's one thing after another.

290
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,530
It's one thing after another.

291
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,130
What's wrong?

292
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,500
Yin?

293
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,600
Yin!

294
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,610
That way.

295
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,710
There was nothing there.

296
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,900
Hell's Gate. This is the gateway to hell.

297
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,490
What is heard from the crack in the earth's surface

298
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,940
are the temptations from the dead in the underworld.

299
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,880
The foxfire burning in his heart is the light of a hell darker than black.

300
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,520
Contractors do not dream.

301
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,430
All they do is make rational judgments.

302
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,350
Episode Twenty-Five Does the Reaper Dream of Darkness, Darker Than Black?

303
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,510
And then, there is no one.
