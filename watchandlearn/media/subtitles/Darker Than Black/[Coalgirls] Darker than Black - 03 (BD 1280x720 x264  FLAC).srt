00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,580
This is the command car. What's going on?

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,620
What happened?

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,460
Do you read me, Tahara?

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,270
I don't know... I can't describe it.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,890
I can't hear you. Was there an accident?

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,520
Where are the other reconnaissance members?

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,220
I told you I can't describe it.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,470
We cannot confirm your vitals or coordinates.

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,260
Your location?

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,260
I'm headed towards the Fukagawa entrance point,

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,330
passing Kiyosubashi.

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,920
We're coming to rescue you. Don't move.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,280
Don't come! You mustn't come!

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,790
This isn't a place man should tread.

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,840
Say that again!

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,640
This is the command car...

18
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,120
Oh, good...

19
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,760
morning.

20
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,050
Good morning.

21
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,280
Good morning.

22
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,170
Morning!

23
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,120
Oh, how commendable of you, taking out the garbage in the morning.

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,780
If only everyone else followed the rules like you, Li-san.

25
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,610
That cat...

26
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,380
I've seen this black one around here lately.

27
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,070
It's probably the same one that's been rummaging through the garbage at night.

28
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,220
Is that so?

29
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,220
What a naughty cat.

30
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,090
It seems like someone's been feeding him.

31
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,550
You better watch out, too. Pets are forbidden here.

32
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,120
Okay.

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,160
Off to school?

34
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,650
No, I'm going to my part-time job.

35
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,430
It better not be a sleazy job.

36
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,560
Of course not.

37
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,250
I'm running late, so...

38
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,620
Really?

39
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,890
Speaking of which, don't they eat anything with four legs in your country, besides tables?

40
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,630
I haven't tried it myself, but...

41
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,830
It might taste good.

42
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,730
I'll be going.

43
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,940
Alright, take care.

44
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,550
Hey! Ouch!

45
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,330
Hey, you! Wait... Hey, you stupid cat!

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,700
Bat.

47
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,040
One hundred and forty yen.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
School Visitation Day Notice

49
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,420
Li-kun, Li-kun, Li-kun.

50
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,180
Yes?

51
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,510
Can you deliver this to the annex?

52
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,270
Annex?

53
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,980
You know, to Consultant Tahara's place in front of the office.

54
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,880
Isn't a consultant a high-ranking position?

55
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,930
Maybe.

56
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,770
It looks like he's been sleeping there and not going home. I have no idea what he's working on.

57
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,930
They say he was once an important scientist.

58
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,790
Before he came here, he was apparently conducting strange research abroad.

59
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,200
Heard about the Hell's Gate First Reconnaissance Troop?

60
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,030
Rumor has it that he was the sole survivor of the incident.

61
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,650
Reconnaissance troop...

62
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,280
They say he lost his soul in that gate.

63
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,390
Well, I don't know whether it's true or not.

64
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,860
Consultant, there's a package for you.

65
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,890
Consultant Tahara?

66
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,980
It's unlocked.

67
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,570
Um, the factory manager asked me to hand you this.

68
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,840
I-I'm sorry.

69
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,800
Forget it.

70
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,160
Aren't you being paid by the hour?

71
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,610
Huh? Oh, yes.

72
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,150
Get back to work if you're finished.

73
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,250
Yes.

74
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,100
Your room number is 802.

75
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,560
Thank you.

76
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,270
In order to avoid bankruptcy, you need that man's power, right?

77
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,370
Let's hurry and obtain it if that's the case.

78
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,660
Isn't that why I'm here with you?

79
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,470
There are necessary procedures one must follow in order to conduct business.

80
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,420
Those procedures are a pain in the ass.

81
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,400
Honestly speaking, I hate you contractors.

82
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:57,000
Do you know why we're breathing the same air, even though it stinks of your bad breath?

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,210
Reluctantly, all for the sake of business.

84
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,930
Furthermore, do you know why you're acting indifferently, despite what I just said?

85
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:12,180
It's because you're a piece of garbage that can't manage to live without the protection of your patron.

86
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,420
If you understand where I'm going with this, don't ever second-guess me.

87
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,180
Where's the bottle opener?

88
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,600
I see.

89
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,840
I better work hard so you don't throw me away.

90
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,520
If he declines, we'll move on to the next step.

91
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,450
We'll keep going until he says yes.

92
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,530
If he still won't concede, we'll persuade him by force.

93
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,900
That's how I handle things.

94
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,910
Hey! Go away!

95
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,310
Hey, what are you doing in a place like this?

96
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:12,970
Yes?

97
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:19,190
Consultant? There's a call for you from the headmaster of Nishi Toyotama Middle School.

98
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,890
Huh?

99
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,660
Hey, you!

100
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,210
Do you have a Japanese driver's license?

101
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,880
I'm asking if you can drive a car!

102
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,120
Yes.

103
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,510
A New Star Shines in the Dawn Sky...
(Part One)

104
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,510
Episode Three

105
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,180
Geez, you're heartless.

106
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,660
Two employees from Meyer & Hilton checked into a hotel at Shinjuku thirty minutes ago.

107
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,170
How are things on your side?

108
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,200
Why is this person here?

109
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,920
Well, you were under the custody of your mother,

110
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,470
but ever since your mother passed away, you've been living with your father, correct?

111
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,540
In that case, your legal guardian is...

112
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,860
I don't consider a person who only comes home once a month as my legal guardian.

113
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,870
My, we're lucky the notice came to the school and not to the police, but...

114
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,290
I'm telling you that I didn't commit arson!

115
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,350
However, the person who witnessed it said you were burning trash at the back of the building.

116
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,490
I wasn't the one who burned it!

117
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,590
It was burning right in front of me before I realized it.

118
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,110
Why... Why don't you believe me?

119
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,590
We'll be leaving now.

120
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,990
We're going home!

121
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,680
W-Wait a minute...

122
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,160
Mr. Tahara, I still have more to say...

123
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,820
Mr. Tahara!

124
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,040
Are you telling the truth?

125
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,460
Was the trash burning on its own before you realized it?

126
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,650
Is this the first time?

127
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,970
Do these occurrences happen frequently?

128
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,750
Did you eat something strange?

129
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,130
When did you start acting unconsciously?

130
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,850
Talk about a rarity,

131
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,400
for you to be talking to me.

132
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,080
Don't touch me!

133
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,030
Mai?

134
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,900
What? A chauffeur? You're like a celebrity!

135
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,210
Are you going anywhere?

136
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,430
The same place, as usual.

137
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,410
It's dangerous.

138
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,110
Is it okay?

139
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,200
No problem.

140
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,300
Let's go.

141
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,840
O-Okay...

142
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,500
Is it okay?

143
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,120
It doesn't concern you.

144
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,840
Hurry up and return to the factory.

145
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,390
You've recently been acting as if your mind has been drifting, Mai.

146
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,060
I think my soul has been drifting on occasion.

147
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,250
Tired from doing too many chores?

148
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,940
You don't have a mother, do you, Mai?

149
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,780
Yeah.

150
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,440
But you have a father, right?

151
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,240
Yes and no.

152
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,370
What do you mean?

153
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,380
Are you doing the cooking, Mai?

154
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,460
I am.

155
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,790
I'm also eating by myself.

156
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,930
Your dad doesn't come home?

157
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,870
How come?

158
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,690
I don't know.

159
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,130
Why don't you eat dinner at my place from now on?

160
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,260
Huh?

161
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,470
I have a brother and sister, so it's kind of noisy, but...

162
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,280
Meals taste better when there are people around.

163
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,500
Papa and Mama will be glad to have you, so come over!

164
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,510
Yuka, what about me?

165
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,380
We won't have any food left if you come.

166
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,280
Huh?

167
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,070
I guess I'll have to decline.

168
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,490
Mai?

169
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,450
My father might come back today for once.

170
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,340
I see.

171
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,520
Yeah, you know...

172
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,000
A lot of things happened, so I'll probably be lectured.

173
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,010
I see.

174
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,140
Next time, then.

175
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,980
Sorry, Yuka.

176
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,530
Thanks.

177
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
How many times do I have to tell you before you understand?

178
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,800
I've been saying that I won't return to your company.

179
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,250
In that case, we'll be forced to change our attitude.

180
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,920
Are you okay with that?

181
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,880
I refuse!

182
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,730
Yeah, it's me.

183
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,920
We're proceeding to the next step.

184
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,720
That's right.

185
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,830
The daughter.

186
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,770
Excuse me. Miss?

187
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,780
Um...

188
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,770
I'd like to pay for both of these items.

189
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,900
Yeah, sure...

190
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,820
So what are you doing at this time of night?

191
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,510
Middle school student?

192
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,290
Are your parents with you?

193
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,070
That's none of your business.

194
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,630
Young lady...

195
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,740
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,650
I'm her older brother.

197
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,320
Hey, don't follow me!

198
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,160
What? Did that person tell you to keep an eye on me?

199
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,050
If he did, tell him this:

200
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,530
You're annoying!

201
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,570
Leave me alone!

202
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,120
I don't want to see your face!

203
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,710
Don't ever come back again!

204
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,310
I hate...

205
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,920
you...

206
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,430
Do you feel better?

207
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,200
Let's go home. I'll walk you back.

208
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,360
I don't want to go home.

209
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,950
I don't want to go back to that dark and empty room.

210
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,500
Then let's play until morning.

211
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,250
Huh?

212
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,220
It's a little scary.

213
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,990
Can you close your eyes for a second?

214
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,670
Huh?

215
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,510
Okay.

216
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,270
Hey!

217
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,250
I'm hungry.

218
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,170
Here you go.

219
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,160
The capricious patissier's parfait with fresh fruit and choux chocolat, topped with rice dumplings and almond seeds!

220
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,130
I see. So you're from China, Li-san.

221
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,260
You speak Japanese well.

222
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,010
It may not look like it, but I've been living abroad.

223
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,560
My family lived in Africa until I entered grade school...

224
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,980
Okay, as an exception,

225
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,480
I'll show it only to you, Li-san.

226
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,810
Take a close look.

227
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,670
See?

228
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,960
The glow was stronger in the past.

229
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:49,170
It gradually became darker, and now it even disappears from time to time.

230
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:55,210
When I was a child, Papa told me there was an amulet inside that was protecting me.

231
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,130
Your father told you that?

232
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,680
Was he a doctor?

233
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
No.

234
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,040
What did he do?

235
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,920
Research.

236
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,600
A scientist?

237
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,550
What kind of research did he do?

238
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,090
I don't know.

239
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,680
Li-san, why did you come to Japan?

240
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,250
To study abroad.

241
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,070
Do you have any brothers, sisters, or family?

242
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,350
No, I don't.

243
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,320
I see. You're the same as me.

244
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,260
It's almost time for the first train.

245
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,600
It's moving,

246
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,340
but it isn't the one.

247
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,710
Li-san, you're kind of like an... older brother.

248
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,830
We're going into the next alley.

249
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,700
Huh? Li-san?

250
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,040
Run!

251
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,350
Don't think! Run!

252
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,770
Hey, you can't come in here!

253
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,330
Hey!

254
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,660
Yes, Kirihara speaking.

255
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,480
Boss, it's a new star!

256
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,890
A star has appeared!

257
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,330
Moratorium, those who have deferred the conditions of their contract.

258
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,290
Power that doesn't come with an immediate price requires a larger compensation.

259
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,850
The withering affection is a one-way ticket with no return.

260
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,750
Its destination, either heaven or hell.

261
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,760
Her scream will become a new flare, and her fate will be sealed.

262
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,240
Everything will be engulfed by the roaring flames.

263
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,450
