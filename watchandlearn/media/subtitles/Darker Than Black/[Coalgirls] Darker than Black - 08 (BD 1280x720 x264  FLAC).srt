00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,590
An employee directory dating back to ten years.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,570
It should be sufficient if we're able to trace the records to that extent.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:17,240
If we can find the corporate spies who stole them, the identity of the contractor who's after them will eventually turn up.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,210
Still don't know where Mao is?

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,040
I'm searching for him now.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,210
We're from the police.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,840
There are a few things we'd like to ask you, madam.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,420
W-Where the hell am I?

10
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,730
Dental records identified the corpse as Katsuragi Toshiko, the owner of the house.

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,740
It's only natural to conclude that she fell as she leaned on the banister, which gave under her weight.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,480
It seemed plausible, since it was an old house.

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,340
That's why it would have been filed as a mere accident

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,350
until you came into the picture, Matsukichi.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,550
I threw away that name along with my past.

16
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,310
My name is Gai, Kurasawa Gai.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,140
What are you showing off for, you idiot?

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,190
Is there any connection between the cosmetic company suicides and this incident?

19
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,460
I left that job because I was sick of the lack of imagination.

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,120
The reason you quit being a cop was because you never had any sense of imagination, period.

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,670
Detective work doesn't suit you either.

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,890
You should go back to your homeland

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,340
for your own sake, Matsukichi.

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,160
My name is Kurasawa Gai, private investigator.

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,210
It definitely isn't Matsukichi.

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,620
The case that started out as a search for a cat has developed into one about an ex-wife's mysterious death.

27
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:05,530
My intuition tells me it'll develop into an even bigger case.

28
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,970
I found him.

29
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,750
You're not going to your part-time job at this time of night, are you?

30
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,930
Why are you loitering around here?

31
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,880
Is there something wrong with taking a walk?

32
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,720
Around here, though?

33
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,560
The stars are pretty.

34
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,050
Stars?

35
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,170
What are you talking about? It's overcast.

36
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,430
Are you all right?

37
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,230
I suppose they questioned you about every single detail.

38
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,200
The police are rather insensitive.

39
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,020
I apologize on their behalf.

40
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,010
No, it's not something you should be apologizing for, Mr. Detective.

41
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,180
About the cat that was found...

42
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,420
Cat?

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,660
Yes, the cat.

44
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,790
Oh, that cat.

45
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,420
It wasn't her.

46
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,930
It was a different black cat.

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,180
It resembled her quite a bit, though.

48
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,180
It's completely different.

49
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,770
My Mii-chan has a more sophisticated face.

50
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,190
Damn! If I could only use the wireless...

51
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,390
This is bad. Am I going to be sent to the pound?

52
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:59,710
While Toshiko was still married to Yuzuki, she came to my place one day.

53
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,600
His former wife?

54
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,610
Yes. She told me to break off the relationship with Yuzuki.

55
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,260
She spoke in an elegant manner, without the slightest change in her voice,

56
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,300
but her eyes were terrifying.

57
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,800
That must have been a frightening moment.

58
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:26,220
It was then when I noticed she wasn't wearing any perfume.

59
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,800
Yuzuki...

60
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,220
My husband didn't tell that woman to wear perfume,

61
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,590
which meant that he didn't dislike her body odor.

62
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,890
I became mortified for some reason.

63
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,390
Wouldn't you feel the same way?

64
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,560
A person's body odor is an intrinsic trait.

65
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,840
It was as if he told me I looked better with heavy makeup instead of none at all.

66
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,240
There was more to her relationship with Toshiko than I had thought.

67
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,260
By simple deduction, she was the one responsible for Toshiko's...

68
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,710
No, it can't be.

69
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,090
C-Cat?

70
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,570
H-H-Hey!

71
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,260
Are you telling me to take this thing?

72
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,090
That reminds me. That glutton was hanging around Toshiko's house, too.

73
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,670
Don't tell me he was the one who did that to Toshiko.

74
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,180
No, no, no.

75
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,690
Damn. Everyone's suspicious.

76
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,740
Hey, don't interrupt me while I'm thinking!

77
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,390
What the hell am I supposed to do with this cat?

78
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,550
I might as well throw him into the river.

79
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,310
Hey! Animal cruelty of that magnitude isn't tolerated these days!

80
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,490
Who's there?

81
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,810
I'm not going to hurt you.

82
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,320
Return that jacket without saying a word.

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,320
You're the one I met at the open air cafe.

84
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,570
He's the one.

85
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,080
Are you after me?

86
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,370
Why?

87
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,520
Hand over the jacket.

88
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,840
I get it. Are you involved in this case?

89
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,700
You are, aren't you?

90
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,840
Case?

91
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,100
It looks like you do know something.

92
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,980
What do you know?

93
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,760
Are you a contractor as well?

94
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,610
Contract?

95
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,070
A contract to kill the former wife?

96
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,260
Former wife?

97
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,520
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,940
Whatever.

99
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,020
If you have no intention of returning it...

100
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,840
This is the worst host ever.

101
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,460
He has athlete's foot.

102
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,960
He possessed that guy.

103
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,550
You should have returned the jacket without saying anything.

104
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,720
Hold it!

105
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,020
It's inside this jacket, isn't it?

106
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,310
Au revoir!

107
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,420
Getting used to an unfamiliar host is so annoying...

108
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,920
This crow...

109
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,950
I see.

110
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,970
You're the cat from before.

111
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,360
So you're a possession-type contractor, too?

112
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,530
What if I am?

113
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,170
You've lost it as well.

114
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,110
What?

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,210
Your body.

116
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,310
H-Hey!

117
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,190
Hei!

118
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,020
Another contractor?

119
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,780
Move to his blind side.

120
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,780
He won't be able to possess your body if you stay away from his line of sight!

121
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,060
W-Wait!

122
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,020
Hei! Shit! Help me!

123
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,530
Episode Eight The Scent of Gardenias Lingers in the Summer Rain... (Part Two)

124
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
I can't believe it.

125
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,830
What were you doing swimming at this time of year?

126
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,120
I have no idea.

127
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,730
You shouldn't stick your nose into frivolous matters.

128
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,140
You're going to lose your balls.

129
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,820
A man's job is tough.

130
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,070
Did you find the cat, Miss Flat Chest?

131
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,060
Again with the sexual harassment...

132
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,620
Oh, about that garbage mansion case...

133
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,280
It looked interesting, so I checked it out.

134
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,790
If you get too involved in this case, you'll have your balls taken as well.

135
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,570
Not that you have any to lose.

136
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,330
I'll seriously sue you.

137
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,970
More importantly, I heard a strange rumor around the neighborhood.

138
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,320
It's about this person.

139
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,100
The widow.

140
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,500
What?

141
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,570
Now that's bureaucracy at its finest.

142
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,220
They've finally taken action.

143
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,800
What's that?

144
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,200
Is this from Huang?

145
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,260
Yes.

146
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,960
Doesn't seem like there's any doubt about it.

147
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,790
What do you think, Mao?

148
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,470
Mao.

149
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,630
Oh, sorry.

150
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,330
I was just receiving data from the network.

151
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,430
Network?

152
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,830
Haven't I told you?

153
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,020
The deficient brain capacity of a cat is compensated by a server.

154
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:01,270
If I don't do this occasionally, the feline conscience becomes dominant, just like when I was lost in that garbage mansion.

155
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,330
That's him all right.

156
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,780
Ukiyama Norio, a manipulator of gravity.

157
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,200
Gravity?

158
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,980
Doesn't he use possession?

159
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,480
I don't know.

160
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,080
Together with another contractor that has the ability to possess bodies,

161
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,440
who goes by the name of Amitabh Kapoor, they've been particularly active in North India.

162
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,840
It's him.

163
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,530
Who?

164
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,760
Kapoor possessed Ukiyama's body.

165
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,960
However, due to an accident during the possession, Kapoor lost his body.

166
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,870
Where have I heard that story before?

167
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,200
According to the police, the ex-wife had a chronic heart condition.

168
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,400
Is that so?

169
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,780
She probably suffered a heart attack while she was walking along the staircase,

170
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,620
when she leaned on the banister and unfortunately fell.

171
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,320
There's little doubt about whether it was an accident.

172
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,110
However...

173
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,750
However?

174
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,560
Do you think I'm the culprit?

175
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,780
It was an accident.

176
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,300
Was it?

177
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,800
Why did you have me go to the ex-wife's place?

178
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,430
It was because of my cat.

179
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,630
There's no way she could have taken the cat.

180
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,560
Remember the trend some time ago

181
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,570
when people used to place plastic bottles filled with water to ward off cats?

182
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:30,190
It would be difficult to imagine someone who disliked cats that much would take her, even if it was to annoy you.

183
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,170
You were looking for someone to send to that house from the beginning

184
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:41,240
in order to find her body and frame as the killer, in the best case scenario.

185
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:48,740
I have a witness who saw you near Toshiko-san's house almost six months ago,

186
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,300
the estimated time of her death.

187
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,360
You had plenty of motives to have her dead.

188
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,020
You're the perpetrator, aren't you, madam?

189
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,520
Do you have any proof?

190
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,140
I don't have any evidence.

191
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,040
Call it an investigator's intuition.

192
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,920
Madam, I didn't want to acknowledge it.

193
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,760
Turn yourself in.

194
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,620
What's so funny?

195
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,070
It isn't possible for evidence to exist.

196
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,050
She was already dead by the time I went to visit her.

197
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,470
I certainly went there six months ago.

198
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:34,400
I had overheard her house had become a garbage mansion, so I wanted to see for myself.

199
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,110
Why would you do something like that?

200
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,480
It was Yuzuki's home since he was a child.

201
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,480
I couldn't stand the thought of it being tainted by her.

202
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,730
It was worse than I imagined it would be.

203
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,490
I couldn't restrain myself, so I went in to say something.

204
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,700
Is she away?

205
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,340
However, believe me,

206
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,800
I didn't ask you to go to the mansion to frame you as the killer.

207
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,560
Having her body not be found for such a long time and left neglected like that slightly scared me.

208
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,300
In any case, I was being used.

209
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,100
I'm sorry.

210
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,140
Why didn't you notify the authorities at the time?

211
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,380
I didn't want to be involved in the investigations.

212
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,830
No, that's not it.

213
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,700
That's how I felt about it,

214
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,340
Are you the one who called me out here?

215
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,760
but it had crossed my mind.

216
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,750
The body odor of the woman Yuzuki liked should turn into a rotten musk.

217
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:16,720
She deserved to rot amongst garbage and emit a vile stench.

218
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,330
Why did you go that far?

219
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,330
It seems to me you were the one who stole him from his ex-wife.

220
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,090
The reason why she trashed her own house could have been triggered by the shock.

221
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,670
You're the one who gained everything!

222
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,970
What did I really gain?

223
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,910
Yuzuki covetously used all of his senses...

224
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,980
Looking, feeling, licking...

225
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:54,200
If it was limited to that, I couldn't lose against Toshiko's aging body.

226
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,090
However,

227
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,390
from Yuzuki's perspective,

228
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,200
everything was about smell.

229
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,880
Smell?

230
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,170
Yes, he had an obsession for odor.

231
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,690
That person truly smelled every single detail.

232
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,130
It was as if every part of my body had been exposed.

233
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,680
But the odor he really loved

234
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,450
wasn't my scent.

235
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,270
Once I receive the goods from you, I'm saying farewell to this miserable country.

236
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,660
How unfortunate.

237
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,360
You're...

238
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,550
Did you do it?

239
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,570
It's a strange feeling.

240
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,470
When you experience that kind of treatment, you begin to believe that body odor has real significance.

241
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,670
How can I put it...

242
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,860
It's as if it becomes a part of yourself.

243
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,370
In hindsight, the only thing I obtained was the title of a wife.

244
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:23,600
I could never get what I really wanted.

245
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,410
What are these?

246
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,850
It's what the corporate spies took and what he tried to steal.

247
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,480
It's probably related to the gate.

248
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,050
Hand it over.

249
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,940
Let's go, Mao.

250
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,540
Mao?

251
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,060
He was sniffing a sock.

252
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,480
His remuneration, huh?

253
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,220
He didn't have any time to use his abilities.

254
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,290
In that case...

255
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,380
He probably just wanted to smell it.

256
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,570
There's no way to understand how a contractor thinks.

257
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,660
Yeah, you're right.

258
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,830
He just wanted to smell it.

259
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,100
If this sock was originally his,

260
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,360
the scent of this sock would be the only remaining evidence of his physical past.

261
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,300
He probably completed his remuneration

262
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,360
when he lost his body, like I did.

263
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,310
It's raining again.

264
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,430
Excuse me...

265
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,690
Is there something else?

266
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,450
Thanks...

267
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,060
See you tomorrow.

268
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,160
Bye-bye!

269
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,090
Oh, Hernandez?

270
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,590
Or is it?

271
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,610
Hey, wait up!

272
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,690
You lost something.

273
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,820
In the end, the cat was never found.

274
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:24,820
It might have been a farce from the beginning. A lost cat may have never existed at all.

275
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,820
Oh well.

276
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,640
I received the remaining payments in the name of grievance money.

277
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,290
The case was closed.

278
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,370
I found that person!

279
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,460
He was at the Home Run Ken eating enough ramen to die from!

280
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,850
He's cool!

281
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,320
Can I stalk him?

282
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,260
Don't do it.

283
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,020
Since then, I occasionally see that young man.

284
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,350
Upon further investigation, I've come to the conclusion that he's just a glutton.

285
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,230
What was I suspecting him of?

286
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,780
So goes the saying, "suspicion begets fear".

287
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,960
Mao, Huang is looking for you.

288
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,750
What? I was in the middle of a dream.

289
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,540
Do you have dreams?

290
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,260
Of course I do.

291
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,160
They're all trivial dreams, though.

292
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,260
About eating, bathing, frivolous stuff like that.

293
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:31,260
Sleeping all day without being yelled at is probably the only good thing about being a cat.

294
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,820
What's with the gloomy face?

295
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,250
You're supposed to laugh at that part.

296
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,280
The reunion of a friend is an ominous twist of fate.

297
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,510
The memories of her school days are faint,

298
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,820
leaving only the lingering scent of friendship.

299
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,410
The scheme underneath the white dress conceals

300
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,420
a dark conspiracy and a bloodbath.

301
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,280
The stone-like glitter of the flower

302
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,930
is cold and drives people insane.

303
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,390
The party has just begun.

304
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,290
Episode Nine The White Dress, Stained with the Girl's Dreams and Blood... (Part One)
