2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,730
What is this?

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,420
It's a statement from the group responsible for the attacks.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,470
They're demanding public recognition of contractors,

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,990
as well as greater authority and rights as contractors.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,240
Is this really what they said?

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,910
I don't know. However, there's no denying that acts of terrorism have been committed

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,630
and that a group called the Evening Primrose exists.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,370
Evening Primrose...

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,960
Is BK201 related to them in any way?

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,200
Kirihara, what I'm about to tell you is strictly confidential.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,440
Don't tell anyone.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,630
Sir!

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:56,740
The leader of this terrorist group is a former MI6 conspirator known as February, Messier Code UB001.

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,270
Five years ago, she was in the front lines at Heaven's Gate.

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,220
It didn't look like he went out to see an ex-girlfriend.

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,740
Did he look like a man who wanted revenge?

18
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,840
Officials were concerned that he still had feelings for her,

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,960
but it seems they were worried about nothing.

20
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,180
I guess we should observe him a little longer.

21
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,940
What happened between those two?

22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,720
It's best you don't know for your own sake.

23
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,320
I guess it can't be helped. I'll give you a hint.

24
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,280
Hei was betrayed by that woman,

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,730
and the rest of his team died in South America.

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,790
The first star ever recorded at that time was hers.

27
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,720
A myriad of stars began to shine as if they were reacting to her.

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Included in that group was BK201.

29
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:09,100
Immediately following that incident, a 1,500 kilometer radius of South America disappeared from the face of the Earth.

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,110
Cheers!

31
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,890
Hey, you guys! That's enough!

32
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,850
There's no hope for any of you if you start drinking during the day.

33
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,020
What are you talking about?

34
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,920
Drinking while the sun's out

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,450
is what the gusto of life is all about!

36
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,260
Geez...

37
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,060
My, off to work?

38
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,940
Yes.

39
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,870
It's good to know that you have your priorities in order, Li-san.

40
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,700
Not really.

41
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,420
Hey, handsome! Why don't you join us?

42
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,660
Ah, sorry... I have to go.

43
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,550
Why not? Live a little!

44
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,720
Hey! Don't drag an honest young man like him into your worthless lifestyle!

45
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,690
Come on, now! On your feet! Go! Meeting adjourned! Move! Go!

46
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,690
Party crasher.

47
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,340
Sir, please wait!

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,440
You can't leave until the bill has been taken care of.

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,400
I told you that I forgot my wallet!

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,580
I'll bring it tomorrow, okay?

51
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,890
But, sir...

52
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,910
That does it!

53
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,990
Hold it right there.

54
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,560
Who the hell are you?

55
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,390
I'm Sakurai of the Nakazawa family.

56
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,940
Nakazawa family?

57
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,810
Pay your bill and get the fuck out.

58
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,690
You're asking for trouble if you start pissing me off.

59
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,650
Let your fists do the talking.

60
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,410
E-Excuse me...

61
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,020
You're in the way!

62
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,140
Hey, you... Are you making fun of me?

63
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,250
You bastard!

64
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,730
Stay still!

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,860
Are you all right?

66
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,220
You fucking punk!

67
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,140
Um... Please calm down...

68
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,870
Hold it!

69
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,620
M-My store...

70
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,530
Amazing...

71
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,130
I'm going to kill you.

72
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,250
Stop it!

73
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,020
Do you really want to die?

74
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,020
Aniki!

75
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,810
You're making quite a scene, sir.

76
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,570
One must pay his dues.

77
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,950
Who are you?

78
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,960
Get up!

79
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,700
Here.

80
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,730
Thanks.

81
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,510
Um... I'm...

82
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,280
Sakurai Kenji-san of the Nakazawa family, right?

83
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,180
I'm Li Shun Sheng.

84
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,560
Li-san...

85
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,500
You're Chinese, as I thought!

86
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,600
"As I thought?"

87
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,230
Wasn't that Chinese martial arts?

88
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,960
You were dodging the enemy as easily as a butterfly.

89
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,990
I bet you could have taken care of him even if Aniki didn't come, Li-san.

90
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,490
You'd shout "acho!" while doing it, too.

91
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,820
No, I don't think so.

92
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,020
Come on, you don't have to be so modest.

93
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,150
Kenji.

94
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,380
Nice job!

95
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,130
Thank you very much!

96
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,860
Kenji, a gangster who's been underestimated isn't much of a gangster.

97
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,960
I'm sorry!

98
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,940
Thanks for looking out for him, man.

99
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,520
Well, it's part of the job.

100
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,420
Take this and treat him to a decent meal.

101
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,130
Thank you very much!

102
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:26,810
Let's go.

103
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,380
Nice job!

104
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,670
Here you go.

105
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,250
Are you sure you're okay with this?

106
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,960
It's really good.

107
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,460
You sure do eat a lot, don't you?

108
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,520
Could this be the secret behind your strength?

109
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,600
Like I said, it isn't.

110
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,800
Stop being such a tease and tell me.

111
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,640
Are you really sure you were okay with beef bowls?

112
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,080
Since I have some money on me, I can take you to gentlemen's clubs if you're interested.

113
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
No, I'll have to decline.

114
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,670
I see. Distancing yourself from women is the secret behind your power.

115
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,290
Um...

116
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,840
Don't worry. I'll make sure we reach your house.

117
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,680
But...

118
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,830
I caused a lot of trouble for you today, so I insist.

119
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,820
What the...

120
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,290
That's strange...

121
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,640
Sorry for the trouble.

122
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,460
It's okay.

123
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,860
You don't have much, do you?

124
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,040
Well, all I do is sleep when I come back.

125
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,400
Li-san, what do you do with your spare time whenever you're not working?

126
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,570
Nothing.

127
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,460
Nothing?

128
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,560
Didn't you come to Japan to train?

129
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,460
No, I came to study.

130
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,280
Oh, you're a student?

131
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,840
What the hell was that?

132
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,900
Oh, the usual.

133
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,010
The usual? That noise just shook the entire room, you know.

134
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,960
It's pretty early, too.

135
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,770
It's probably the same people from last night.

136
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,090
Can you even focus on studying with this noise?

137
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,460
It's not a big deal once you get used to it.

138
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,980
You're practically at their mercy!

139
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,890
Let me resolve this issue permanently.

140
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,780
W-What is it?

141
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,390
What do you mean, "what is it"?

142
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,340
Who are you?

143
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,760
Sakurai of the Nakazawa family.

144
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,060
Nakazawa family?

145
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:26,700
Hey, hey, hey! What the hell were you thinking, playing a guitar that loudly in a shoddy room with paper-thin walls?

146
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,250
Who did that?

147
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,720
What the hell were you thinking?

148
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,860
What are you going to do about that?

149
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,370
Yeah, that'll do.

150
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,370
Let's have lunch.

151
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,530
I bet you're all hungry from causing this ruckus.

152
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,120
Itadakimasu.

153
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,900
You're from the Philippines?

154
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,150
Are you working in Japan by yourself?

155
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,930
Yeah. My parents and siblings are still over there, so I send them money every month.

156
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,530
It must be tough.

157
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:22,360
Not really. The Japanese are all rich perverts.

158
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,630
I bet.

159
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,890
Why are you in Japan, rock star?

160
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:33,650
I'm a missionary who came here to preach about the essence of rock.

161
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,660
Wow! Essence, huh? That's pretty far out, man.

162
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,090
Why, you little...

163
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,520
How about you?

164
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,550
I came from Israel to study Japanese animation.

165
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,200
You came all the way here just for that?

166
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,950
What are you saying? Japanese anime is the best in the world. Besides...

167
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,670
Yeah, yeah. Your explanations are always too long, so let me stop you right there.

168
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,810
This is a pretty diverse apartment, isn't it?

169
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:01,380
Yeah. I'm fluent in seven different languages because of these tenants.

170
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,490
Wow, this place sure is interesting.

171
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,530
Maybe I should live here, too.

172
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,900
Right, Li-sa...

173
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,860
You've got to be kidding.

174
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,440
You just ate tons of beef bowls...

175
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,870
Do you want seconds, Li-san?

176
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,750
Ah, please.

177
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,490
Isn't he done yet?

178
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,620
Thanks for the meal!

179
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,690
Now that we're full...

180
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,420
Let's start the second round!

181
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,540
Are you guys in?

182
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,320
Booze? Great! Right, Li-san?

183
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,240
Sorry, but I have an appointment to keep.

184
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,310
That guy is really unsocial.

185
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,970
We barely talked to him until today.

186
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,040
Well, whatever.

187
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,760
Some people don't like to interact with others. Come on, let's drink.

188
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,340
Is that so?

189
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,900
Don't you think there's a lonely aura emanating from Li-san's back?

190
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,730
Episode Seventeen A Love Song Sung from a Trash Heap... (Part One)

191
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,940
Hitotsubashi, it's not that I dislike a man like yourself.

192
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,790
I'm honored.

193
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,750
However, I will not tolerate internal feuds.

194
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,430
I don't understand.

195
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,990
Don't play dumb!

196
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,990
Ohshita.

197
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,960
I know you've been taking Ohshita's territory.

198
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,690
Rest assured. I have no intention of inciting this conflict any further.

199
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:51,050
Stay out of sight for a while. I'll eventually assign you to a proper position.

200
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,510
I know about your potential more than anyone else.

201
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,060
Is that clear?

202
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,660
I'll make sure it's engraved within my mind.

203
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,070
Hitotsubashi, you say?

204
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,570
Did he show up at the club already?

205
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,770
Yeah.

206
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,690
Keep an eye on it.

207
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,660
The goods should be brought there within the next few days.

208
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,450
Be careful not to interfere with the transaction.

209
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,750
We know it'll all be in vain if we screw up the deal.

210
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,570
That aside, who is that kid?

211
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,070
Kid?

212
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,060
There's no need to worry about him.

213
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,780
Are you sure?

214
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,390
I don't want any distractions during the mission.

215
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,680
I know.

216
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,280
Oh, welcome back.

217
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,860
Where is everybody?

218
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,110
They fell asleep.

219
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,590
Good! Thank you for everything.

220
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,190
For what?

221
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,290
You provided me with shelter from the rain.

222
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,470
I could have called for a cab with that hundred grand.

223
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,590
I didn't think about that.

224
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,720
Li-san, you're a strange person.

225
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,260
Let's meet up for a meal sometime.

226
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,120
Okay.

227
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,820
Good evening.

228
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,390
Oh, it's you, Li-kun.

229
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,990
I had trouble reaching you since you don't have a cell phone.

230
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,160
Sorry for the late notice, but we won't be able to work for three nights, starting today.

231
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,260
What happened?

232
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,010
Construction work. Remember the problems we were having with the bathroom?

233
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,130
Oh, I see.

234
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,270
You'll be on paid leave while the construction's going on.

235
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,200
That's very kind of you.

236
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,730
A-Aniki, what did you just say?

237
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,360
I said I'm going to divide the organization.

238
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,570
The organization...

239
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,220
I'm indebted to the boss, but he's become senile.

240
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,650
A gangster in need of stability isn't much of a gangster.

241
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,580
Why are you telling me this?

242
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,960
I have a job for you.

243
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,220
Kenji, come with me.

244
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,060
A-Aniki, what is this?

245
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,160
It can't be...

246
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,090
Hey.

247
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,670
Are you surprised?

248
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,150
Aniki!

249
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,290
Wake up.

250
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,700
A-Aniki, this is...

251
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,000
A doll.

252
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,720
Doll? She's human!

253
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,850
Wrong.

254
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,700
It's a state-of-the-art doll that will do anything it's told to do.

255
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,110
There are rich people out there who want these kinds of toys.

256
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,210
Take care of her for the next two or three days.

257
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,760
If you don't feed her, she'll die.

258
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,350
You'll have to take care of her excretions, too.

259
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,640
She's precious merchandise.

260
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,560
Make sure you keep her clean.

261
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,960
Merchandise...

262
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,030
I'm counting on you.

263
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,560
Don't get caught up with dirty thoughts.

264
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,190
Um...

265
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,490
Why did you get him involved?

266
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,880
The merchandise might become tainted unless an idiot like him takes care of it.

267
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,970
Don't worry. He doesn't have the balls to betray me.

268
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,490
I thought I'd have to kill someone since he said he had a job for me.

269
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,970
Hey, you. Where did you come from?

270
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,390
What's your name?

271
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,450
You don't understand Japanese, do you?

272
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,810
Don't look at me like that.

273
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,360
What are they going to do with you?

274
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,370
BK201-related information? I already told you everything I know.

275
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm sure you have, but it still doesn't make sense for some reason.

276
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,320
The mysterious group that calls itself E.P.R., their statement,

277
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,440
and BK201.

278
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,790
Are they enemies or are they working independently?

279
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,910
What's his objective in the first place?

280
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,160
We don't know anything,

281
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,960
yet they're telling us to go after them.

282
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,500
Say, did Hoshimi-sama say anything else?

283
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,860
Any new analytical data...

284
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,450
Hey, that's enough.

285
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,360
I was pulling all-nighters until a little while ago.

286
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,970
I don't want to talk about work while I'm home.

287
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,030
Sorry.

288
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,030
Misaki, aren't you off-duty tomorrow, too?

289
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,350
Yeah, why?

290
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,380
You're probably not doing anything, so why don't you come with me?

291
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,790
What the...

292
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,670
Are you sure you weren't noticed?

293
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,850
We're not that careless.

294
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,090
Why's the doll missing?

295
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,340
Who knows? It was probably stolen from them, I bet.

296
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,020
Stolen, huh?

297
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,200
You might be right.

298
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,130
What do you mean?

299
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,420
There's been internal conflict within the Nakazawa family recently.

300
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,980
Yin, can you find it?

301
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,710
Damn.

302
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,880
What are you going to do?

303
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,640
Let's back off.

304
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,950
It's best not to look into it too much.

305
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,520
Whether we continue the mission or not isn't a decision we can make.

306
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,900
I'm going to submit a request, so everything's on hold until then.

307
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,490
Li-san...

308
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,500
I'm sorry!

309
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,600
Can we use your place as a hideout?

310
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,370
The jewel in hand gives off a clear, uncolored glow,

311
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,130
its purity calling near the specter of devastation.

312
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,760
Their two worlds were never supposed to have crossed.

313
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:59,640
They have nowhere to go, and their flight will continue without end.

314
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,480
They didn't even want to know what lies ahead of them.

315
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,340
And so, the boy lies down in the trash heap.

316
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,350
Episode Eighteen A Love Song Sung from a Trash Heap... (Part Two)
