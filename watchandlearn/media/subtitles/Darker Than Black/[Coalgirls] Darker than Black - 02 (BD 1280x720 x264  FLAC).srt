00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,850
Did you know that whenever a star shoots by, it signifies that one of their lives has ended?

3
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,910
A contractor just died somewhere in this world.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,790
The starry sky disappeared and was replaced with an imitation ten years ago.

5
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,500
Cold-blooded, supernatural beings known as contractors...

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,790
Soulless physical entities called Dolls...

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,340
Various governments, who feared that information about contractors and Dolls would become widespread,

8
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:49,720
utilized new, gate-derived technology called M.E. to erase the memories of those who came into contact with them.

9
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,210
Those very countries were taking advantage of their newfound abilities at the same time.

10
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,740
You know a lot about it.

11
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,530
I've been working at a research lab for some time.

12
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,430
I learned things I shouldn't have known, whether I wanted to or not.

13
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,540
Besides, it seems we're destined to be acquainted for some reason.

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,100
I think it was during high school when my parents died in an accident.

15
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,610
Well, that's what I was told. The truth was a little different.

16
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,040
I witnessed it... The sight of a contractor killing my parents.

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,450
I think I became fascinated by them...

18
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,790
ever since that day.

19
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,680
The Division of Astronomy simultaneously confirmed French agent activity.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,990
His name is Jean, and he has the ability to perform a material exchange type of teleportation.

21
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:48,520
Although the crime scene was identified through an observer apparition search, no clues were found.

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,420
My sincere apologies. I missed a great opportunity to apprehend him.

23
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,510
Although taking occasional breaks is important, dropping your guard could prove to be fatal.

24
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,330
There are signs of activity from that BK201 we're looking for.

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,180
Be careful.

26
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,640
Roger!

27
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,280
This is all your fault.

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,020
Huh? Why?

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,900
Umitsuki Apartments

30
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,410
I see... So they're already on to us.

31
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,320
You should change quickly. I'll be in my room next door.

32
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,450
If there's anything...

33
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,820
So it's true... What took place today...

34
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,180
Louis is a contractor, and he's dead.

35
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,900
Wait!

36
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,380
Don't leave me by myself.

37
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,950
Don't turn on the lights.

38
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,090
How strange... I should be used to the layout of the rooms,

39
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,820
but seeing the other symmetrical half is a little weird.

40
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,870
It's almost as if it's fake...

41
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,640
It's only been two weeks since I moved in.

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,510
During that time, I actually felt as if I was alive.

43
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,220
It was the first time I felt that way.

44
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,550
I thought it would be impossible for me to work at a club.

45
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,060
Once I tried it, it became surprisingly addicting.

46
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,600
One part of me was constantly mired in research, as if it were possessed. The other part was as I am right now.

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:42,320
I couldn't tell what my real personality was. I was even more confused because Louis was coming to pick me up soon,

48
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,370
which made me feel overjoyed.

49
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,950
It looks like I can't go back.

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,290
Do you have any plans?

51
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,940
Of course not.

52
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,920
Louis was my only hope.

53
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,770
I'll help you out somehow.

54
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,200
Huh?

55
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,140
Let's run away together.

56
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,090
But... But you just moved in today.

57
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,650
I was probably destined to come here today

58
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,900
and meet you.

59
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,950
It said so on my horoscope.

60
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,510
What are you saying? You're more than capable of running away by yourself.

61
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,760
Forget about me.

62
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,910
They saw my face, though.

63
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,210
Sooner or later, this room will be...

64
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,440
Can I... trust you?

65
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,140
Whoa...

66
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,780
Someone beat us to it.

67
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,620
In any case, let's search for clues.

68
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,490
Think something will turn up?

69
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,220
A cat, huh?

70
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,810
There's an acquaintance of mine...

71
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,780
He conducts trading-related business in Macau.

72
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,680
He can provide passports and the like.

73
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,090
Counterfeit? You mean like forging documents for illegal residency?

74
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,740
You told me you were an exchange student, didn't you?

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,290
I have my own set of circumstances.

76
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,790
When did this country become so dangerous?

77
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,220
However, lots of money will be necessary.

78
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,980
Money, huh?

79
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,500
I should have withdrawn more from the bank.

80
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,560
If you have something that's worth money...

81
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,570
How about information?

82
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,920
Information?

83
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,980
Like confidential information obtained by illegally accessing Pandora's central system.

84
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,820
Really?

85
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,420
Gate-related information usually sells at a high price,

86
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,430
no matter how insignificant it is.

87
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:37,090
It's the most revolutionary theory since those on compressed gravitational repulsive elements and the M.E. technology.

88
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,530
It'll definitely sell for a high price.

89
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,590
Don't worry, Haraguchi-san.

90
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,960
Haraguchi is a pseudonym. My actual name is Chiaki.

91
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,050
Shinoda Chiaki, that is.

92
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,200
Chiaki-san... That's a nice name.

93
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,890
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

94
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,100
My name is Li Shun Sheng.

95
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,200
Nice to meet you, Li-kun.

96
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,520
That's a good name.

97
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,740
Thank you for waiting.

98
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,460
Is this everything you ordered?

99
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,370
Yes.

100
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,850
Enjoy your meal.

101
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,870
I did say you could order anything you wanted, but are you really going to eat everything?

102
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,750
I'm sorry. This is less than what I usually eat, though...

103
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,360
Listen, you're going to get fat.

104
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,600
For sure!

105
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,930
It might be okay for you now, but after you turn thirty, you're definitely going to become obese.

106
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,010
If that doesn't happen, there's something wrong with the world.

107
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,940
Then again, who am I to be worrying about the future?

108
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,170
Are you okay?

109
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,430
I've been feeling a little tired lately.

110
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,430
Go ahead and eat.

111
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,320
I see. Although I've already heard about it, I'm impressed with how you conduct yourself.

112
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,370
Huang...

113
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,490
There isn't a better fit for these kinds of jobs than your kind.

114
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,770
After all, you don't have the slightest sense of guilt.

115
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,620
You have an idea about where the goods are, right? Hurry up and acquire it.

116
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,940
They're already here.

117
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,920
Trash the woman before she becomes a hinderance.

118
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,340
Thank you very much.

119
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,000
Welcome!

120
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,420
Party of two?

121
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
Sir...

122
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,000
Hey, you can't...

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,630
Hey, wait!

124
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,620
Hurry!

125
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,880
Are you okay?

126
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,830
Don't worry.

127
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,250
Jean?

128
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,990
They escaped. Let's reconvene.

129
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,770
Yeah. It's the mouse, there's no mistake.

130
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,680
Episode Two The Fallen Star of a Contract... (Part Two)

131
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,290
He's been offline.

132
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,790
What's going on? Don't tell me he's going to double-cross us.

133
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,740
He has nothing to gain by betraying us in this situation.

134
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,250
Contractors don't act unless they benefit from doing so.

135
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,280
Well, he's acting strange.

136
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,840
Why didn't he waste the broad already?

137
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,680
He's taking too much time.

138
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,290
I must admit he's pretty unconventional.

139
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,090
What is Hei doing?

140
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,890
I don't know.

141
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,560
What?

142
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,340
There's no water near him.

143
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,160
Does it hurt?

144
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,910
No.

145
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,930
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

146
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,040
It's impossible after all...

147
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,610
We can't run away from them.

148
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,580
Your face looks tired,

149
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,880
as if you were already dead.

150
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,140
You should rest now.

151
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,970
I am tired...

152
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,810
I've had enough of this charade.

153
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:54,430
Every time I try to run away, they appear before I realize it.

154
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,190
Always intruding upon my life...

155
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,610
I won't forgive them.

156
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:08,580
But even more unforgivable is that, despite everything, I keep watching them in the corner of my eye.

157
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,920
What's wrong with me?

158
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,000
But I realized it.

159
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:20,380
That time... When my parents died, I saw everything but I didn't testify against them.

160
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,860
The contractor was still a child.

161
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,760
Although I couldn't see the face...

162
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:34,980
The glow of the Lancernopt synchrotron radiation I saw in the dark lingered in my head.

163
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,650
It was beautiful.

164
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,440
It was my own life, yet it felt like I was watching someone else's dream.

165
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,360
Do you understand?

166
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,920
You would be better off without them...

167
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,310
The memories of a contractor.

168
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,890
I couldn't bring myself to forget about these memories.

169
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,140
I wouldn't be the person I am today if I had forgotten them.

170
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,380
These feelings scare me.

171
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm sure you have your own memories you wish you were able to forget.

172
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,990
Contractors aren't people. They're killing machines beneath the guise of a human.

173
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,230
I know.

174
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,440
Witnesses are always eliminated in order to minimize risks.

175
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,440
They're liars and traitors.

176
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,880
Service suspended

177
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,690
How did they know?

178
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,570
You must forget.

179
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,230
What's the matter?

180
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:40,980
Hey!

181
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,260
This is Saitou. A call came in from the Mita Precinct that stated they were taking Shinoda, the missing woman, into custody.

182
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,370
The presumably French agents were also seen.

183
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,840
I'm on the way to the scene.

184
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,710
Affirmative. I'll call for assistance immediately.

185
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,350
Activity from BK201 has been confirmed by the Division of Astronomy.

186
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,190
Roger.

187
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,490
Boss, this is Matsumoto.

188
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,880
Shinoda Chiaki's corpse has been identified.

189
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:12,890
What?

190
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,560
Can you stand?

191
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,740
Come over here.

192
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,210
Hold it!

193
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,270
Are you a contractor?

194
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,140
So you're the one who killed Louis.

195
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,110
You... killed Louis?

196
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,400
That's right.

197
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,550
You're lying...

198
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,240
Didn't I already tell you? Contractors are liars.

199
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,120
The mouse was caught in the trap.

200
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,940
That woman isn't Shinoda Chiaki.

201
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,640
She's only a Doll with the memories of Shinoda Chiaki, extracted from her by the M.E.

202
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:46,140
By saying the keyword, she has been detached from her programmed personality.

203
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,280
In any case, her personality would only have lasted two or three more days.

204
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,030
It was a trap in order to lure you here.

205
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,710
To think he fell for it so easily...

206
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,620
Was Louis really killed by this guy?

207
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:10,590
Unfortunately for you, Hei's jacket provides a bulletproof effect while he's wearing it.

208
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,310
Surprised?

209
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,130
Alain!

210
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,200
Damn!

211
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,720
As I thought, this one was a decoy.

212
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,200
The goods have been confiscated through another route.

213
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,360
The syndicate predicted everything.

214
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,200
Why didn't you destroy that doll?

215
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,970
She wasn't a Doll. She was alive.

216
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,020
It's just a doll, a passive medium.

217
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,420
Much like how you contractors are mere killing accessories.

218
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,520
Enough, Huang. Our work isn't finished.

219
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,420
Yin, where is he?

220
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,840
I have a lead on him.

221
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,410
Yes?

222
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,630
Excuse me. We're from the police.

223
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,930
I wanted to inquire about your neighbor, Haraguchi-san.

224
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,290
Have you noticed anything peculiar about her?

225
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,920
I only recently moved in, so I don't know...

226
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,060
Are you from abroad?

227
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,680
Excuse me, but may I see your alien registration card?

228
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,920
Yes.

229
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,290
Okay, thank you very much.

230
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,350
If you remember anything about her, please contact me.

231
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,170
I appreciate your cooperation.

232
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,330
Boss, is something wrong?

233
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,740
No, it's nothing.

234
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,440
Let's go, Saitou.

235
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,120
Yes.

236
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,180
Hell was supposed to be confined within the fog.

237
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,280
The blue light released by the petal is a memento of the forgotten past.

238
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,430
Stop it. She's not to blame.

239
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,360
The scream becomes inaudible, and the illuminated star signifies the mark of a contract.

240
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,390
A permanent curse that cannot be erased.

241
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,380
Eventually, the light will be extinguished.

242
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,490
