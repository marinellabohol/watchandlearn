2
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,430
Freeze!

3
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,600
Put your hands up and slowly turn this way!

4
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,370
Damn! A contractor, huh?

5
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,130
The suspect is moving northeast.

6
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,300
He's a contractor.

7
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,530
Report from headquarters:

8
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,690
GR544 activity acknowledged.

9
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,230
His alias is Louis, a French agent.

10
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,960
Affirmative, direction of the wind confirmed.

11
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,540
Move the police to the east to circumvent him.

12
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,530
Roger.

13
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,760
Notice to all personnel: the suspect is a contractor by the name of Louis.

14
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,230
He has the ability to create a gravity block, therefore the use of automatic weapons is permitted.

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,960
Once confirmed, fire without hesitation.

16
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,980
So that's the price of your contract, huh?

17
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,640
Pretty troublesome.

18
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,410
Observer apparition... A Doll?

19
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,540
Where is it?

20
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,210
I... I don't know.

21
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,050
I'm telling the truth... a woman has the stash.

22
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,750
Where is she?

23
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,290
Which syndicate are you from?

24
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,970
Depending on the terms, I can retrieve the goods from the woman and have it delivered to you.

25
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,060
A practical decision indeed, typical of a contractor.

26
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,280
Tell me more about it.

27
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,650
Yin, where are the police?

28
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,670
You have three minutes.

29
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,510
They're passing through Point A.

30
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,210
It's about time.

31
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,350
Let's pull out.

32
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,000
Wait...

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,990
If I don't come with you, the woman won't hand over the goods...

34
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,270
Hei, no!

35
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,900
We can still use him.

36
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,250
People like you make me sick.

37
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:21,860
Hei!

38
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,580
Boss, a star just passed by.

39
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,750
I know.

40
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,290
Ten years have passed since its appearance...

41
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,070
It's getting difficult to remember how the scenery looked before the wall was there.

42
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,120
What took place that day...

43
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,530
and what lies beyond it...

44
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,880
No one knows.

45
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,700
The only thing mankind could do was build a tall wall and conceal everything.

46
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,520
It was referred to as "Hell's Gate".

47
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,960
Beings with unique abilities, called "contractors",

48
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,420
and the existence of passive mediums called "Dolls"

49
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,260
were said to have been identified one week after the appearance of the gate.

50
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,270
Tokyo Metropolitan Police
Hatsudai Provisional Office

51
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,400
Goes by the alias of Louis, his actual name is unknown.

52
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,300
An agent contractor who's said to have connections with the French Foreign Security Secretariat.

53
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,660
His Messier code is GR554.

54
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,370
He has the ability to create a gravity block.

55
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,810
At this moment in time, French authorities are denying any involvement.

56
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,200
Cause of death?

57
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,420
Unknown. There were no traces of asphyxiation or reactions to chemicals.

58
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,460
Do you think it's the act of a contractor?

59
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,790
According to reports from the Division of Astronomy,

60
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,040
the stellar number of the prime suspect who was most active during that time was...

61
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,880
BK201, an unidentified number.

62
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,090
Unidentified?

63
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,640
Yes, every case he's been involved in has been left unsolved.

64
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,350
The victim's cause of death and details of his abilities... We don't know anything.

65
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,110
Don't tell me it's that rumored "cursed" contractor.

66
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,990
Rumors are merely rumors.

67
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,770
Why are you guys, of all people, getting caught up in them?

68
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,660
Right...

69
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,240
What were the goods?

70
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:20,130
Confidential information obtained via illegal access to the central system of Pandora from the National Research Institute.

71
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,520
As for the contents, we aren't authorized to know the details.

72
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,720
What about the woman?

73
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,320
Shinoda Chiaki, twenty-six years old.

74
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,210
She received her master's degree by writing a dissertation about the physical properties within the gate.

75
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,200
After graduating, she was employed by the National Research Institute.

76
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,600
She has been AWOL from work for the past two weeks. Her present status is unknown.

77
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,710
There are reports of her involvement with contractor-associated cases...

78
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,710
Has her memory ever been erased by the M.E.?

79
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,800
Regarding her parents?

80
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,800
At the time, it was concluded that she wasn't in contact with them.

81
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,710
A leak of gate-related information is a direct threat to national security.

82
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:01,080
We must prevent the witness from falling into the hands of the enemy.

83
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,360
Do you understand, Kirihara?

84
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:04,720
Yes.

85
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,070
Ordinary people who come into contact with contractors have their memories erased.

86
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,480
All information regarding contractors is to remain top secret.

87
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,030
Even so, the rumors never stop.

88
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,210
Monsters... Killing machines...

89
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,860
Public sentiment towards them is that of fright and suspicion.

90
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,230
My name is Kirihara Misaki.

91
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,310
This case marks the first time the contractor, known as BK201,

92
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,410
and my Department of Intelligence's Fourth Division of External Affairs cross paths.

93
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,320
Yeah?

94
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,550
What? Deliveries?

95
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,600
N-No.

96
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,850
Cult solicitation? Not interested.

97
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,530
No... um...

98
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,600
Oh, you're the gravestone salesman who keeps calling all the time.

99
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,190
Stop bugging me! I told you I didn't need one yet!

100
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,920
It's not that... The real estate agency in front of the station...

101
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,210
Oh, the electronics shop next to the realty agency!

102
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,460
I've been waiting for you! Hurry in!

103
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,360
It's been acting like this for a while.

104
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,170
Right...

105
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,090
Um...

106
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,820
Hey, old man!

107
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,600
The reception's horrible when you stand there!

108
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,390
You're the one who told me that if I switched to the digital whatever, there wouldn't be any static.

109
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,990
No, I'm just...

110
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,410
This ain't a TV from the old days... You think you can fix it by doing that?

111
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,520
You're right.

112
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,420
They haven't disclosed it.

113
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,300
It's fixed.

114
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,420
And because it's enclosed under a thick veil...

115
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,910
You're kidding!

116
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,590
If I recall correctly, you're Li...

117
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,160
Li Shun Sheng.

118
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,760
Li-san, right?

119
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,070
That's right. I heard from the realty agency.

120
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,160
Are you from China?

121
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,310
Yes, I'm an exchange student.

122
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,980
Well, I know it must be difficult coping with the cultural differences and such, but...

123
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,690
Get along with your neighbors and don't cause any trouble!

124
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,700
Yes.

125
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,250
Ah, Haraguchi-san!

126
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,350
He'll be moving into this room from today...

127
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,510
I'm Li Shun Sheng.

128
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,080
Li-san, you got that?

129
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,140
You don't need to force yourself to be too friendly.

130
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,880
O-Okay.

131
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,550
I've confirmed the target.

132
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,470
Show me what you're made of...

133
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,020
The so-called black Grim Reaper.

134
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,650
Episode One The Fallen Star of a Contract... (Part One)

135
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,610
Say, say, say, say.

136
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,440
I bet you're still in your teens, Ayame-chan.

137
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,180
Come on, I'm already twenty-two!

138
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,760
Oh, next week's my birthday, so come over and celebrate!

139
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,200
That goes for the customer over there as well!

140
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,940
I got it, I got it.

141
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,700
What do you two do for a living?

142
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,550
What do you think?

143
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,130
Financial business? Loan sharks?

144
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,450
No way.

145
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,300
Land sharks?

146
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,050
Why do you think that? It's a more respectable business.

147
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,630
No way! I bet you're one of those folks.

148
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,980
W-We're civil servants, you know, civil servants.

149
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,720
Come on! The only civil servants with such rugged faces are detectives.

150
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,280
Excuse me, gentlemen.

151
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,730
It's time for the next rotation.

152
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,240
Bye-bye. Make sure to call for me next time.

153
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,040
Next week... Promise!

154
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,190
Sure, sure.

155
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,900
I thought that girl looked like her.

156
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,700
A completely different impression, though.

157
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,590
Women sure can masquerade themselves well with make-up.

158
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,740
Isn't it risky to be in this kind of place anyway?

159
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,650
Don't worry. We can write it off as a business expense.

160
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,440
No, not about that! If the boss hears about this...

161
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,360
Welcome!

162
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,150
Hey!

163
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,900
Sir, it would be most problematic...

164
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,240
if you were to act as a stalker toward our girls.

165
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,540
Wrong!

166
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,110
This is the police! Clear the way!

167
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,570
Halt!

168
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,570
Are you being chased?

169
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:17,990
Huh?

170
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,810
This way.

171
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,030
No, I have to run away!

172
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,840
Quiet!

173
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,890
But...

174
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,820
E-Excuse me!

175
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,270
Were you gazing at the stars?

176
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,750
Yes.

177
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,750
In the middle of the city?

178
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,250
Yes.

179
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,670
Even when you know the stars in the sky are all fake?

180
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,190
Have we met before?

181
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,190
Haraguchi-san?

182
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,090
Huh?

183
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,660
As I thought, right?

184
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,310
From Room 202?

185
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,900
I'm Li. I moved in next door just today.

186
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,900
I-I have to go.

187
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,670
Thanks.

188
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:38,780
Um...

189
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,700
Chiaki, it's me, Jean.

190
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,740
Jean!

191
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,960
I'm glad you're okay.

192
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,450
Jean, what's going on? Where's Louis?

193
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,650
Quiet.

194
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,200
Louis was tied up with some complications.

195
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,850
Who are they?

196
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,560
It looks like they're cops.

197
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,270
They suddenly came into the club.

198
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,250
They're already on to us.

199
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,460
Is there anyone else who came into contact with you?

200
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,650
No... What happened to Louis?

201
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,470
I can't tell you much right now.

202
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,580
All I can say is that he's taking refuge somewhere safe.

203
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,990
You still have it with you, right?

204
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,110
Where is it now?

205
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,410
Louis told me not to tell anyone else.

206
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,540
Not even a partner.

207
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,070
Take me to Louis!

208
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,610
I know it's dangerous!

209
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,720
You...

210
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,510
Are you okay?

211
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,400
No, get away from here now!

212
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,120
But...

213
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,040
Run!

214
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,200
Lancernopt synchrotron radiation?

215
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,650
Contractor...

216
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,690
Are you going to be okay with this kind of team?

217
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,930
Any changes to the plan can result in unexpected setbacks.

218
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,820
We have to act carefully.

219
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,720
Just like this.

220
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,590
Doesn't it look beautiful when they're aligned like this?

221
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,310
It's pretty difficult, you know.

222
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:02,060
Then again, I have no idea why the hell I'm doing this.

223
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,730
This is the price I have to pay for my contract.

224
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,040
Good.

225
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,040
Louis is dead.

226
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,540
You're lying...

227
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,420
It isn't a lie. Louis is dead.

228
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,560
He was murdered.

229
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,900
It wasn't expected...

230
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,810
for a contractor as formidable as Louis to appear.

231
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,830
Contractor?

232
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,980
Louis was a contractor, too?

233
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,560
That's right. You weren't supposed to know.

234
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,560
Who was that man?

235
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,080
Huh?

236
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,010
The man who hit me on the head.

237
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,990
He's probably not alive anymore, but he seemed like someone you knew.

238
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,520
I-I don't know.

239
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,080
I met him for the first time today.

240
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,210
Really?

241
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,190
Not that it matters. We don't have any time.

242
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,780
I'll use the quickest way.

243
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,630
How insulting. I may not look it, but I'm pretty sensitive.

244
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:19,590
Even us contractors can be equipped with a personality, depending on the program,

245
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,280
unlike Dolls.

246
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,230
What's the matter?

247
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,420
I sensed something.

248
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,750
It can't be.

249
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,780
There's nothing there...

250
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,470
An observer apparition?

251
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,250
Huh?

252
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,210
Only contractors must be able to see it.

253
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,470
Wait!

254
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,580
That's strange. The security system for the electronic lock had a triple fail-safe.

255
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,610
You're right.

256
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,900
It's too much to be a coincidence.

257
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:46,060
The rain has stopped, but the starry skies that appear beyond the clouds are fake.

258
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:53,170
Gentle words reach out to a closed heart, and the woman steps out...

259
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,250
into the dark chasms of a bottomless marsh.

260
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:04,590
What the man sees in the fake sky is the shimmer of life that burns blue.

261
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,920
And a star falls.

262
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,250
