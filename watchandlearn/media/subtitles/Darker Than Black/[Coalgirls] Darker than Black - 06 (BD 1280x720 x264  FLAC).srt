2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,330
Answer me!

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,420
You were there during that day when South America vanished.

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,630
You, Amber, and Pai were all there.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,440
What happened?

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,230
Why are we the only ones here?

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,930
Where are they?

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,300
Where's Pai? Where's my sister?

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,910
I'm not a part of their group.

10
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,570
I don't know anything about Amber or anyone else.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,910
I don't even know if they're alive.

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:55,570
In order to carry out orders from the syndicate, I was definitely in South America that day.

13
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,910
However, I don't remember anything since that incident.

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,070
When I regained consciousness, I was already abroad in a rural area of Europe.

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,730
For some reason, I had also lost my abilities.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,030
I never set foot outside that town since.

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,320
I was just... alive.

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,460
A quiet life, empty of the syndicate and my contract.

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,820
I wasn't asking you about that!

20
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,030
How can I make you believe me?

21
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,580
I don't have the information you're looking for.

22
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,250
If you've ever established a contract, you would know better than anyone else.

23
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,690
The greatest priority of a contractor doesn't lie with the syndicate nor its ideologies.

24
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,800
It lies with himself.

25
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,110
There's no merit in being tortured and remaining silent.

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,700
However, it doesn't seem like you understand that.

27
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,480
Before you became a contractor, you were more heartless than anyone else

28
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,500
and feared by people as the black Grim Reaper.

29
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,230
Now that you're a contractor, you've lost yourself over a trivial matter about your sister.

30
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,390
Shut up!

31
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,750
You're emotional, but you're unlike the mentally unstable Moratorium.

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,400
There aren't any signs of your remuneration.

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,260
Are you really a contractor?

34
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,160
BK201...

35
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,650
Every case that involves this cursed contractor is full of mystery and death.

36
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,240
What is the organization that's lurking behind him?

37
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,530
How's MI6?

38
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,290
They've returned to their hotel rooms.

39
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,060
Don't worry. Matsumoto-san and Kouno are watching over them.

40
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,970
I won't let them do as they like in Japan anymore.

41
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,560
I see. So this is the place

42
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,130
that July was able to detect.

43
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,260
November 11!

44
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,070
I've been looking for you, Misaki.

45
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,890
I dispatched two of my men in an effort to contact you.

46
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,080
Excuse me.

47
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,570
It's Kirihara.

48
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,700
Boss! I'm sorry, but I've lost track of November.

49
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,420
They're already here.

50
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,090
Huh?

51
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,240
Never mind. Regroup.

52
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,080
Is everything all right?

53
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,900
Yes.

54
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,680
Where shall we begin?

55
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,870
Huh?

56
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,780
Please give us instructions as well.

57
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,830
Thank you for the generous offer, but...

58
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,590
I don't need to remind you that our target is considered a cursed contractor.

59
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,300
Although I don't know what the enemy's objectives are,

60
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,390
it's a fact that the regressor, once feared as the most diabolical contractor in history, was taken away from us.

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,770
We are partly to blame for that.

62
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,270
If possible, we would like to avoid any casualties.

63
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,700
Allow us to assist you.

64
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,710
Don't worry. We'll make sure he releases Havoc without laying a finger on us.

65
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,710
Understood.

66
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,910
Boss!

67
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,470
Please lend us a hand.

68
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,610
This is...

69
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,480
You still eat a lot, don't you?

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,730
Do you always make it yourself?

71
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,490
I never thought meals could be enjoyable until I lost my abilities.

72
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,810
I only ate because I had to.

73
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,530
However, I learned how to cook after I met Laura's family.

74
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,210
In the beginning, it didn't seem like the children liked my cooking.

75
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,080
As time passed by, they started to say things like "I want to eat this" and "I want to eat that".

76
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,420
I was happy.

77
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,020
I wanted to make more delicious meals for them.

78
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,530
I wanted to see their happy faces.

79
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:55,530
This was coming from someone whose remuneration for her contract was drinking the lifeblood of children.

80
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,570
Delicious.

81
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,560
Laura's mother once said,

82
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,930
"Don't trust men who can cook well.

83
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,450
They're bound to be evil people."

84
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,230
I'm kidding.

85
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,450
Did I upset you,

86
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,720
even though you're a contractor?

87
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,220
You've really changed,

88
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,210
but not in a bad way.

89
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,990
It's strange.

90
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,990
It's the first time I've seen you smile.

91
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,650
I'm still not used to it.

92
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,920
Well, that goes for both of us.

93
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,490
I might not be the only one who's experienced these things.

94
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:40,290
Everyone might still be alive, just like you and me.

95
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,100
I'll cooperate with you.

96
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,540
Take me to the gate.

97
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,790
If you do, my abilities and memories from that time might return.

98
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,060
I might be able to remember something about where your sister is.

99
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,570
Promise me one thing, though.

100
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:08,940
If... If I revert back to my former self, kill me right away.

101
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,870
I found them.

102
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,910
Where are they?

103
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,080
Ichigaya Yanagichou.

104
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,270
They're on the move.

105
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,420
It's not that far away.

106
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,770
Which direction are they going?

107
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,650
East.

108
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,580
Episode Six Red Giant over Eastern Europe... (Part Two)

109
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,200
What a strange feeling.

110
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,210
You could say it's kind of nostalgic.

111
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,810
A feeling that would disturb the mental composure of any contractor.

112
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,240
Is it because we're getting closer to the gate?

113
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,640
I understand why the researchers were anticipating Havoc's awakening.

114
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,890
We'll bring her into custody before that.

115
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,370
We will, won't we?

116
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,150
If she awakens, submachine guns like those won't stand a chance.

117
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,850
In any case, what is Mr. 201 thinking?

118
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,880
I thought Havoc was definitely going to be killed.

119
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,030
Why is that?

120
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:32,430
Who knows? If she regains her memory, it might pose a threat to a certain mysterious syndicate,

121
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,990
which 201 may be an assassin of.

122
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,780
However, she isn't dead.

123
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,570
Furthermore, she's being taken to the gate, just as Pandora wanted to do.

124
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,000
Everything is being done by a single contractor.

125
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,350
It's quite a mystery.

126
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,130
You...

127
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,800
Let's go.

128
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,850
He's there.

129
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,960
Where?

130
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,570
Sotobori Avenue, Kagurazakashita.

131
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,320
Is he with Havoc?

132
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,640
Together,

133
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,600
but...

134
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,720
Kirihara.

135
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,710
This is Ohtsuka. A report from the Division of Astronomy just came in.

136
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,410
Havoc's stellar spectrum has entered optical spectrum status.

137
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,680
Say that again. What about Havoc?

138
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,620
She might regain her abilities!

139
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,210
Request for immediate dispatch of the Special Forces,

140
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,800
but do not fire until I give the order to do so.

141
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,960
Affirmative.

142
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,130
Where's November 11?

143
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,600
He was just here a minute ago.

144
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,530
Boss!

145
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:16,960
Wait.

146
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,420
I'm sorry.

147
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,180
Stay away!

148
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,740
I can feel...

149
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,310
that sensation coming back.

150
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:46,340
I was willing to accept my abilities again if I had been able to change like you did.

151
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,180
But...

152
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,810
I don't deserve to.

153
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,540
If only I had met you earlier,

154
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,260
I could have lived without having to fear the contract.

155
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,050
Kill me.

156
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,830
I'm begging you.

157
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,370
We're going to run away from here.

158
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,090
You're no longer a contractor.

159
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,730
You don't have to die.

160
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,530
It has begun.

161
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,270
I'm scared! No!

162
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,330
I don't want to change back...

163
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,080
I don't want to kill any more!

164
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,030
I don't want to take more lives!

165
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,820
So, please...

166
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,300
You'll be okay. Your abilities won't return as long as you stay away from here.

167
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,310
You won't have to kill anymore!

168
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,800
Isn't that right?

169
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,240
That's enough.

170
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,840
Run away.

171
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,840
I finally caught you.

172
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,590
Unfortunately, you won't be able to reach me from that distance.

173
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,160
Nice, aren't they?

174
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,830
Made in Japan. It's quality rubber.

175
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,980
Electricity can't pass through at all.

176
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,800
Havoc is dead.

177
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,550
Your mission should have been terminated immediately.

178
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,990
I used a lot of my power because of you.

179
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,520
Do as we say without further resistance.

180
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,480
We won't hold you accountable for this incident.

181
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,700
We have no intentions of handing you over to either Pandora or local authorities.

182
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,640
I just want to know about the organization you belong to.

183
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,710
Decide rationally, as a contractor would,

184
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,580
201BK.

185
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,640
Die.

186
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,290
Why didn't she use her abilities?

187
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,260
I had confirmation from the Division of Astronomy

188
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,340
that she had regained her powers.

189
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,240
I didn't know you were so afraid of her.

190
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,350
I'm kidding.

191
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,570
Why did you act on your own?

192
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,690
I'm not going to report this to the syndicate.

193
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,140
If they find out, our asses are as good as dead.

194
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,820
In that case, why didn't you kill me back there?

195
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,080
Don't fuck around with me, bastard!

196
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,930
Huang!

197
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,860
Contractors like you should just shut up and kill people.

198
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:24,720
British Secret Intelligence Service

199
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,030
It's me.

200
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,220
I read the report.

201
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:37,290
Remain there and continue investigating both the organization in question and 201BK.

202
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,830
Hi to all the good boys and girls watching the show this late at night!

203
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,580
We're going to boost the ratings by introducing the obligatory beauty.

204
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,430
She'll easily win the hearts of all the older viewers!

205
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,360
Who's a beauty, you airhead?!

206
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,830
What are you saying, boss?

207
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,350
The audience won't take you seriously unless you make a memorable first impression!

208
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:02,290
In the next episode, "The Adventures of the Detective's Sidekick, Ayanuma Kiko" will begin!

209
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,660
Everyone pay attention and look forward to it, nya!

210
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,810
You could have at least made the title "The Melancholy of Detective Kurasawa Gai"!

211
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,350
Episode Seven The Scent of Gardenias Lingers in the Summer Rain... (Part One)
