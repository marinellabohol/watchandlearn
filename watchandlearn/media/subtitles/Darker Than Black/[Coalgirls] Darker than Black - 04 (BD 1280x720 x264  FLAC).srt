2
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,980
The one who showed up this time sure is pretentious.

3
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:34,450
According to the Division of Astronomy, the spectrum of the detected star contained characteristics of a Moratorium.

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,320
Burned to a crisp, just like the bacon I ate this morning.

5
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,870
Moratorium, huh?

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,540
This isn't good.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,540
What's going on?

8
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,400
Why Tahara's daughter?

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,220
Do you have any particular information on her?

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,850
When I was a child, Papa told me there was an amulet inside that was protecting me.

11
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:25,910
Information about Tahara's daughter being a contractor or something didn't exist until today.

12
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,050
Do you know what this means?

13
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,330
Tahara's research was progressing according to his plans.

14
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,790
We'll obtain both at once.

15
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,840
It's time for work, Ruuko.

16
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,500
No...

17
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,110
It isn't me...

18
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,190
It's not my fault!

19
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,370
Meyer & Hilton?

20
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,350
When the U.K. started mobilizing during the Argentine Coast War,

21
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,380
they supplied the country with contractors for artillery purposes, since they were the first company to implement such weaponry.

22
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,180
I haven't heard any good rumors about them.

23
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,490
Inbreeding in order to mass-produce contractors...

24
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,810
Manufacturing hybrids by breeding distinct supernatural beings...

25
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,770
Experimenting with neurosurgical contract validation on civilians...

26
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,070
What is their relationship with the Moratorium in question?

27
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,380
Unknown.

28
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,420
However, around ten years ago,

29
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,300
a Japanese man was hired as a researcher.

30
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,280
There has been no leakage of details.

31
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,600
Their purpose of entry, the subject of the research,

32
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,640
and the emergence of the new star...

33
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,960
There may be some correlation between them.

34
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,200
Understood. I'll have Saitou and Kouno look into it.

35
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,510
I'm on the trail of the Moratorium.

36
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,520
Hurry, Kirihara.

37
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,510
The Moratorium must be apprehended and quarantined at once.

38
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,820
They are neither contractors nor Dolls.

39
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,520
Rather, they're defective monsters who merely abuse their powers and have no sense of self-awareness.

40
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,360
I'll do my best.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,790
National
Observatory

42
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,300
Boss!

43
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,800
Good work, Inspector.

44
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,800
How's the target, Chief Ishizaki?

45
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,520
Our mediums have tracked it again around Nerima Ward.

46
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,980
However, we have only confirmed the tail end of a strong, sentient resonance.

47
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,950
We have suspended further monitoring activities for the time being.

48
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,880
What about the evacuation alert?

49
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,570
We have already issued one for a five kilometer radius under the pretense of a broken gas line.

50
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,510
It has been a while, Hoshimi-sama.

51
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,720
It's me, Kirihara.

52
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,560
The reason why contractors are called contractors in the first place

53
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,170
is because they have to go through a mentally exhausting, yet necessary procedure,

54
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,980
referred to as remuneration, after using their acquired abilities.

55
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,960
The process of remuneration is deferred for the Moratorium.

56
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,450
After a period of time, most of them alter their states into that of a Doll,

57
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,570
much like our mediums.

58
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:49,310
Unlike standard contractors, the Moratorium cannot control their abilities.

59
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,920
That's what we're dealing with.

60
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,110
To be honest, the Observatory doesn't know any more than what the people from External Affairs do.

61
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,100
Moratorium sightings are few and far between.

62
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,000
I see.

63
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,110
Its pulse seems a little unstable this time.

64
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,330
Long story short, there's no telling what it'll do.

65
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,860
There you go again, raising your brow!

66
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,700
You're not young anymore, so be careful or those wrinkles will become permanent.

67
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,290
You're as old as I am. You're not in a position to say that to me, Kanami.

68
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,510
Don't worry about me. I don't take life seriously enough to develop wrinkles.

69
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,760
You haven't changed at all.

70
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,300
Neither have you.

71
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,520
To all residents: please proceed to your designated evacuation areas at once.

72
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,270
This area is extremely dangerous.

73
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,240
Refrain from using vehicles, do not carry any luggage, and proceed swiftly without panicking.

74
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,650
Mai?

75
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,320
I repeat...

76
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,520
To all residents: please proceed to your designated evacuation areas at once.

77
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,700
What are you doing in a place like this?

78
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,960
If you don't hurry, you'll be in danger!

79
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,380
The gas lines are broken.

80
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,150
Yuka!

81
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,350
Is she a friend?

82
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,700
Oh, yeah.

83
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,120
It's all right, you don't have to be scared. Let's evacuate together.

84
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,990
No, don't come near me!

85
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,850
He's my father, you know.

86
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,110
Go!

87
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,290
Please!

88
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,110
No!

89
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,920
Mai?

90
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,860
Let's hurry!

91
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,360
I said no!

92
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,410
Dad!

93
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,170
What the...

94
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,140
I told you...

95
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,180
I said no!

96
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,970
There it is.

97
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,740
Target sighted at Nakano Ward, Maruyamakita.

98
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,050
Do not antagonize the target.

99
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,450
Wait for the Special Forces to arrive.

100
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,600
A child?

101
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,540
Episode Four

102
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,540
A New Star Shines in the Dawn Sky...
(Part Two)

103
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,610
Dr. Tahara, you're so mean-spirited.

104
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,590
Everything has gone according to your plans, hasn't it?

105
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,760
I'm talking about your research on suppressing contractors from awakening.

106
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:33,240
In any case, I didn't realize your daughter was the subject of your experiments.

107
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,530
Of course, I could personally make a trip to your factory, but...

108
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,040
I would prefer to avoid further casualties.

109
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,900
I will release your daughter.

110
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,710
You have my word.

111
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:54,180
Um... His hair is messy and...

112
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,960
Is it true?

113
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,210
Did you use your daughter as a sample for your experiment?

114
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,830
What did you do to your daughter?

115
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,280
What did you plant in Mai's wrist?

116
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,270
I'm sure you've heard about it before.

117
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,560
I was the sole survivor of the First Gate Reconnaissance Troop.

118
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,210
I had brought a certain material back with me at the time.

119
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:35,590
There was a possibility I could block the activation of a contractor's abilities by implanting it inside their bodies.

120
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,880
I discovered it two years after being employed by Meyer & Hilton.

121
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,650
Around the same time...

122
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,160
M-Mai!

123
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,130
Stop that!

124
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,770
Why?

125
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,890
The way contractors were regarded by the public...

126
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,930
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?

127
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:28,660
By implanting the unknown material found within the gate into Mai's wrist...

128
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,150
I attempted to prevent the activation of her abilities.

129
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,200
I was grasping at straws.

130
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:41,300
No, straws isn't correct. What I was grasping at were seeds.

131
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,730
In retrospect, those seeds may have contained the curse of the gate.

132
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,950
It might have been punishment for treading inside.

133
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,130
The seed implanted in Mai will eventually deteriorate.

134
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,600
After that happens, her ability will be awakened.

135
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,490
As I continued my research,

136
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,810
I came to the conclusion that complete suppression would be impossible.

137
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,930
Furthermore, the host body of the implanted seed would transform into a Moratorium.

138
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,940
There's no telling when its curse will subside.

139
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:23,240
With my own hands, I turned my daughter into a monster that can't even become a contractor.

140
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,900
I destroyed whatever data remained.

141
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,920
I erased Mai's memories using the M.E. and left the company.

142
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,300
I couldn't afford to let them find out about it.

143
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,730
I didn't want her to become the subject of an actual experiment.

144
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,890
So you abandoned everything you had and ran off to this town.

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,240
Didn't I just say it's impossible to suppress the activation of the contract?

146
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,650
Are you saying I should continue this meaningless experiment on my child?

147
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,680
I was able to bring back two seeds.

148
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,610
One is in Mai's wrist.

149
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,310
The other...

150
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,620
If the seed within Mai began to deteriorate to the point of vanishing entirely...

151
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,420
If I could cultivate the seed and implant it again,

152
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:21,760
I'd be able to suppress the Moratorium's instinctual behavior forever.

153
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:28,930
The only time I had peace of mind was when I watered this pot.

154
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,810
However, time stopped this morning.

155
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,350
It didn't bear any seeds.

156
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,190
I was frightened...

157
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,730
Frightened of witnessing the result of my sins.

158
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,870
If I knew this was going to happen, she would have been better off as a contractor!

159
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,660
You're confessing your sins to the wrong person.

160
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,970
You deserve to be confined inside this room forever.

161
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,400
It was supposed to bear lots of fruit.

162
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,050
Mai...

163
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,800
Lots and lots of seeds for your amulet were supposed to come out.

164
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:29,250
And the eyebrow is bushy with spots of whiskers...

165
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,940
Finally here?

166
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,520
Yeah, some dog wandered in.

167
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,590
That idiot!

168
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,680
Koutou Ward, Shinonome warehouse district.

169
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,610
A contractor?

170
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,740
It looks like you and I are alike.

171
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,800
That's as far as you go!

172
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,350
Or do you not care about what happens to Tahara's daughter?

173
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,610
You should have retrieved the daughter instead of going after me.

174
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,480
Really, you hired a strange contractor...

175
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,000
Dr. Tahara.

176
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,200
Return my daughter.

177
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,960
In that case, are you willing to lend us a hand?

178
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,350
I will not return to your company.

179
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,500
I brought referential material from my research instead.

180
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,720
Hand it over.

181
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,430
My daughter comes first.

182
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,180
Hey, your beloved papa has come to pick you up, Mai-chan.

183
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,930
No, I don't know... that person.

184
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,820
No!

185
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,990
H-Hurry up and hand over the documents!

186
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,980
What the hell is this?

187
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,500
References.

188
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,520
What are you trying to pull?

189
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,940
Hand over the real thing!

190
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,760
This is all that's left of my research.

191
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,890
No! No! Let go!

192
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,540
No, Mai's papa is more handsome!

193
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,230
He's stronger!

194
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,440
No, your father is a horrible person.

195
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,060
He's not horrible! He tells me many, many stories!

196
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,310
He protects Mai!

197
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,460
Mai likes Papa very much!

198
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,560
Papa likes you very much, too.

199
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,260
I love you...

200
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,130
Mai.

201
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,490
Forget about him! Get a hold of the sample!

202
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,070
Smiles don't belong on people like you.

203
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,840
Mai...

204
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,370
Mai...

205
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,190
My work... is finally done.

206
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,020
Mai...

207
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,920
I'm home.

208
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,730
Welcome back...

209
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,810
Papa.

210
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,030
Wait... It was Ruuko who did it, not me!

211
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,070
Stop, Mai.

212
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,150
Why?

213
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,780
D-Don't...

214
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,300
Her remuneration.

215
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,780
Did she become a contractor?

216
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,420
A Moratorium?

217
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,420
The probability is practically zero...

218
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,280
Geez, strange things sure do happen.

219
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,070
I'll forget about what happened to Tahara.

220
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,740
I have something much more interesting instead.

221
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,250
I feel as if I've killed many people.

222
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,570
Don't be so depressed.

223
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,490
Contractors exist solely to kill people.

224
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,560
I guess you're not depressed at all.

225
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,720
Where am I going?

226
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,390
Heaven, although it'll be a long journey by ship.

227
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,820
When we arrived at the scene, the Moratorium's location

228
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,830
and Messier code BK201, which was flickering along with it,

229
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,340
could not be traced.

230
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,660
Eventually, investigation of Case Code 1032 was transferred away from the Department of Intelligence.

231
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,070
To this day, no information of any significance has surfaced.

232
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,000
However, one thing's for certain.

233
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,100
The star that appeared that day has yet to fall.

234
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,130
The being who came from Eastern Europe was a woman once referred to as a demon.

235
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,890
Her blank eyes show a pale, cold light full of loss.

236
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,540
A breath escapes from lips that remain sealed.

237
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,490
Is it the devil's whisper or a sigh of relief?

238
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,010
The catastrophic wind was never to blow again.

239
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,430
And the trap was set.

240
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,360
