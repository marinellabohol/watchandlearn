2
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,990
That's not right, Kirsi.

3
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,280
Play it like this.

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,630
Hold the pedal a little longer.

5
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,000
That's what I'm doing!

6
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,230
Play it with a little more emotion.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,130
Emotion?

8
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,620
Your feelings.

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,140
Try and grasp the form for the time being.

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,460
Just the form?

11
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,250
Feelings and form are different.

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,810
I know that mu...

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,170
Listen, Kirsi. Once you grasp the feel of it, your emotions will be able to flow freely.

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,920
For example, if you smile when you're sad, your sadness will lessen.

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,220
I don't understand what you're saying, sensei!

16
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,100
Maybe that analogy was a little too difficult.

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,590
She talks like an adult, but she's still...

18
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,770
Don't treat me like a child, Mama!

19
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,050
What's wrong?

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,280
Sensei, is there a full moon out tonight?

21
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,410
Let's see...

22
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,600
You're right.

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,090
Of course I am, sensei.

24
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,080
I like this light.

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,330
I can't see it, but I can feel its silver glow.

26
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,200
plane crash

27
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,530
Are you sure the people looking for us are already here?

28
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,950
It was information from above, so keep your eyes open.

29
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,700
Geez. We've become popular, haven't we?

30
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,240
Do you have any leads?

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,250
Not yet.

32
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,640
Yin's unreliable, as usual.

33
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,870
She can't even fulfill her only purpose.

34
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,940
Number Six's lips look discolored to me.

35
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,200
Increase the sodium concentration by point zero-one.

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,080
Everything is going according to standard procedure.

37
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,330
Recognize the differences between them, and don't rely so much on monitors and instruments.

38
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,060
They're delicate in body and soul.

39
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,630
O-Okay.

40
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,940
Is something wrong?

41
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,800
No. His lips seemed to move, as if he was talking in his sleep.

42
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,580
He might have been seeing a dream.

43
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,020
Dream?

44
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,310
But mediums...

45
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,530
Just kidding. I know it's been proven that they don't dream.

46
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,830
Then again, maybe they can experience it...

47
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,440
A sweet dream.

48
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,600
Chief Ishizaki, there are some changes in the observer apparitions currently on patrol.

49
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,220
Contractors?

50
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,500
Most likely.

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,750
Several are gathering near a specific coordinate.

52
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,820
I thought I told you not to go out alone.

53
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,350
Did you do that?

54
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,810
Well, it looked like he was spying on us.

55
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,840
One of our targets?

56
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,380
Who knows?

57
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,040
He might have been from a higher level.

58
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:45,560
Let me remind you that our job is to identify their numbers, identities, and abilities.

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,830
We're not supposed to kill them.

60
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,950
It's an emergency! The mediums are...

61
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,820
What the hell is going on?

62
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,260
Retrieve the observer apparitions.

63
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,970
About that... They're not returning.

64
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,700
That can't be.

65
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,030
The only explanation I can think of is that they might have been captured.

66
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,880
How about the stars?

67
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,900
Activity in CY-463.

68
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,640
A contractor that can capture observer apparitions?

69
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,150
How pretty.

70
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,270
What's wrong?

71
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,070
My mind suddenly synced with a doll that sent out an observer apparition.

72
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,900
It isn't a good feeling.

73
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,110
You're still there?

74
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,880
This is too good to be true.

75
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,030
It looks like I was able to establish a connection with one of our targets.

76
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,070
I'm surprised you were able to see her in this picture!

77
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,360
You want me to find this girl, right?

78
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,640
Understand? Can you understand?

79
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,740
Please take the job.

80
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,310
Leave it to us!

81
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,750
But Mr. Foreigner, um... Mr. Kashite... Kashite... Kashite...

82
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,820
Kastinen.

83
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,280
Eelis Kastinen.

84
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,900
Oh, Kastenee-san!

85
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,000
You've come to the right place!

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,610
A famous pianist like yourself, coming all the way from Scandinavia to hire me, Kurasawa Gai...

87
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,030
I didn't know you were well-known overseas, boss.

88
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,470
Gai?

89
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,740
Yes, Gai Kurasawa!

90
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,420
Japanese most famous detective!

91
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,280
Just kidding.

92
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,160
Gai... Gai Kurasawa?

93
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,900
I've been saying that I'm Gai, Gai Kurasawa.

94
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,540
Does the name sound familiar?

95
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,950
You're relatively calm about this.

96
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,160
You've identified the target, haven't you?

97
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,600
Aren't you going to make your move?

98
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,960
Don't panic. It isn't difficult to lure a doll out.

99
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,850
If it hasn't recovered from last night's incident, it'll just wander about

100
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,360
as if it was sleep-walking.

101
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,200
You're all set, then.

102
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,240
By the way, do you have any cigarettes?

103
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,100
Is it okay for you to smoke?

104
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,200
Aren't you supposed to be a singer?

105
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,350
That's a mean way of saying it.

106
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,150
I stood on the stage of Volksoper a long time ago, you know.

107
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,530
I was one of many, though.

108
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,500
It's a problem if I run out,

109
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,410
since it's my remuneration.

110
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,390
What are you writing?

111
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,890
Don't.

112
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:28,050
"A maiden stands still by the lake in the midnight sun, falling into the bright night alone."

113
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,820
"The blank, cold, silver moon, her only companion."

114
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,940
That's my remuneration.

115
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,590
An elegant one, at that.

116
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,570
Not bad. It's a little too feminine, though.

117
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,920
It'd be better if you made it rhyme.

118
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,550
Don't look into it too much.

119
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,800
I've never written a poem in my entire life

120
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,580
until I became like this.

121
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,930
Isn't that great? You still have a soul capable of functioning,

122
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,210
even if it is someone like you.

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,590
I haven't been able to contact Yin since last night.

124
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,400
Does that mean she escaped?

125
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,250
There's no way a doll could act on its own.

126
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,780
She's only been programmed with enough information necessary to live.

127
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,740
What else could have happened?

128
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,000
One of the syndicate's men was murdered.

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,910
This occurred last night as well.

130
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,900
Was it the work of the group that infiltrated the area?

131
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,690
Probably.

132
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,150
There's a possibility that Yin was abducted by them.

133
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,780
Abducted?

134
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,510
In an effort to acquire information about us.

135
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,150
She doesn't have any emotions, but unfortunately for us, she has a great memory.

136
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,500
The syndicate was aware of it, then?

137
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,100
That's how it is.

138
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,100
They've also been keeping tabs on us.

139
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,500
You better be careful.

140
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,400
If worst comes to worst, dispose of the doll.

141
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,020
Hey, you're in the way!

142
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,450
What's with this girl?

143
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,750
Forget about it. Let's go.

144
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,560
Where am I?

145
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,600
She hasn't come back.

146
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,560
Shit! It's that clumsy detective.

147
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,430
She's not here, as I thought.

148
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,490
We're going to ask questions around here, Kiko.

149
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,040
Good luck!

150
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,550
"Ncha"? You're also...

151
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,580
Didn't I tell you I was going to take the rest of the day off?

152
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,440
I'm meeting a friend. I only tagged along because it was on the way.

153
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,090
See you later!

154
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,680
Geez...

155
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,400
Investigator? That guy?

156
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,580
That's him.

157
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,930
He's looking for Yin for some reason.

158
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,310
I see. Let me know if anything happens.

159
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,660
Are you saying I should follow him?

160
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,400
He knows what I look like.

161
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,020
You have an ordinary appearance.

162
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,220
Don't worry.

163
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,690
Episode Thirteen A Heart Unswaying on the Water's Surface... (Part One)

164
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,410
That was wonderful, Kirsi.

165
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,890
Next, whoa...

166
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,070
Is something wrong?

167
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,030
No, I just dropped my penlight.

168
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,160
Oh, let me turn on the lights.

169
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,980
No!

170
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,470
No, I like things as they are.

171
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,300
I like this light.

172
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,170
The moonlight.

173
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,070
Kirsi...

174
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,100
It's all right. I think it's around here.

175
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,130
Did you find the penlight?

176
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,200
Yes.

177
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,490
I see.

178
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,720
Who do they think they're trying to fool?

179
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,820
The character was completely different!

180
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,640
I can't let that writer live.

181
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,730
I'm going to write his name in my notebook.

182
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,240
Geez, even though the artwork was amazing...

183
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,000
That's why they shouldn't make adaptations in the first place!

184
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,710
You're kidding me... It's that girl.

185
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,610
Don't worry. Refills are free, so you don't have to drink sparingly.

186
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,500
You look gloomy. Is that part of your character?

187
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,390
Take my advice and try to smile,

188
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
like this.

189
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,650
How is it?

190
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,010
Cute.

191
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,140
Cute?

192
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,480
See? That's the spirit.

193
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,960
First of all, you have to establish your external features,

194
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,740
whether it's for cosplay or anything else.

195
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,990
Cosplay?

196
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,880
Excuse me.

197
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,150
Bring me some coffee on the way back.

198
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,330
Get it yourself.

199
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,360
Oh, fine.

200
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,770
I'll be back soon.

201
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,850
Which family restaurant is that?

202
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,100
Isn't there something that I'd recognize around there?

203
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,370
What don't you understand?

204
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,180
There's an anime shop on the corner...

205
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,700
Hey, wait!

206
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,450
We're splitting the bill, you know.

207
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,500
You were lured by your own observer apparition,

208
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,260
just as I planned.

209
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,870
You lost sight of her?

210
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,390
Where did she go?

211
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,790
T-That way, I think.

212
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,950
Hey, wait up!

213
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,150
Boss!

214
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:53,040
I can read a doll's mind.

215
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,410
Come here.

216
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,420
It's useless.

217
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,510
Run, Yin!

218
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,950
I won't let you get away!

219
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,260
You're...

220
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,810
W-What the... ?

221
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,490
Watch out, Hei!

222
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,070
It's falling down! Hei, run for it!

223
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,450
Yin!

224
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,730
Get as far away as you can.

225
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,490
Kirsi!

226
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,430
Kirsi...

227
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,930
Kirsi?

228
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,560
Bertha, were you trying to get me killed, too?

229
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,440
Bertha...

230
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,200
It's all right. I'm not swallowing them.

231
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,950
Didn't I tell you this was my remuneration?

232
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,000
Kirsi, it's me, Eelis.

233
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,040
Eelis...

234
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,090
That's right. Do you remember?

235
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:51,520
Yes. Investigations are currently underway, but it will take some time to determine the cause.

236
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,520
Hide her?

237
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,560
Only until she's able to leave the country.

238
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,880
Please.

239
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,410
I don't want to impose, but why was she there in the first place?

240
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,220
To tell you the truth, I don't know.

241
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,160
I only know she was being chased.

242
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,830
Chased?

243
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,890
By who?

244
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,440
She wouldn't say.

245
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,070
Definitely a stalker!

246
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,630
Stalker?

247
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,660
Listen, it's already become a huge story.

248
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,400
There's no doubt about it.

249
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,990
Chasing such a cute girl...

250
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,960
Kirsi-chan, you should stay at my place.

251
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,390
I want to dress you up in...

252
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,900
Idiot.

253
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,770
This isn't a game.

254
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,900
You'll be handsomely compensated.

255
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,160
Well, I suppose I have no choice, since we're already in the same predicament.

256
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,610
That aside, where can we hide her?

257
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,490
A hot spring!

258
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,950
There has to be at least one!

259
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,840
What do you mean by "at least one"?

260
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,320
Everyone's looking forward to it.

261
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,790
Who are you talking about?

262
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,210
Kiko will do her best!

263
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,840
What's the meaning of this?

264
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,620
Not only did you lose sight of the enemy, but you also lost Yin!

265
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,470
What's your excuse?

266
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,400
The next time you see Yin, kill her, regardless of the situation.

267
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,820
Wait a minute, Huang.

268
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,860
Don't you think we'll be playing into the enemy's hand if we become disorganized now?

269
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,010
Disorganized? I'm not your ally, you know.

270
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,360
Don't treat me as one of your own kind.

271
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,820
What?

272
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,540
Don't worry about it. We don't regard you as one of us.

273
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:35,920
Contractors like us don't possess emotions that would make us tremble in fear like you.

274
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,530
Fortunately enough.

275
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,970
Don't be so arrogant! You don't know how frightening the syndicate can be.

276
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,290
Kill Yin, understand?

277
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,350
If you won't, I will.

278
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,450
Why did you have to come along?

279
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,130
It'd be unfair if you went without me.

280
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,330
I'm their bodyguard!

281
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,710
I was the one who suggested a hot spring!

282
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,420
Kirsi...

283
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,220
Let's go back once everything settles down, Kirsi.

284
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,220
Go back?

285
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,100
Yes, back to our homeland.

286
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,810
I'm not going back.

287
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,900
I'm not going back.

288
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,000
The train never had a destination.

289
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,880
The drizzling rain reveals a secret crime.

290
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,200
An unwavering heart, a resolute mind.

291
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,380
You cannot be hurt any further.

292
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,180
Are the days that have disappeared with the moonlight asking for atonement?

293
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,260
The light she felt in the past cannot reach her anymore.

294
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,250
Episode Fourteen A Heart Unswaying on the Water's Surface... (Part Two)

295
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,710
The light will radiate.
