00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,110
Do you believe in the urban legend?

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,230
You can retrieve what you once lost inside the gate.

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,520
However, it comes at a substantial price.

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,540
I wonder what that price is.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,420
Who knows?

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,740
You don't believe me, do you?

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,830
To tell you the truth, neither do I.

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,140
I'm Corinna Moku, a third-year student at Beijing University.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,020
I'm Li Shun Sheng.

11
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,510
Nice to meet you.

12
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,150
It's larger than I thought.

13
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,390
Infiltrate PANDORA's research facility.

14
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,980
Are you serious?

15
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,390
It's right by the gate.

16
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,670
If a contractor goes near a hot spot, he might lose control.

17
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,710
Maybe.

18
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,360
Besides, I don't think he'll be able to pass the initial security check.

19
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,000
That might be true, but the syndicate is serious.

20
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,620
What do they want me to do?

21
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,240
Retrieval.

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
Retrieval?

23
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,430
Two weeks ago, there was an incident involving an explosion at the research facility.

24
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,310
Two security guards were killed.

25
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:21,410
PANDORA, responsible for the investigation, concluded that it was a structural accident caused by faulty wiring.

26
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,920
A few days ago, a covert CIA agent discovered that the explosion was intentionally triggered

27
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,330
in order to steal the gate-proprietary substance referred to as the "meteor fragment".

28
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,610
It still hasn't been transported outside of the wall, has it?

29
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,990
That's how the syndicate sees the situation.

30
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,280
What's to be done after the retrieval?

31
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,930
You're to transport it out of the gate in their place.

32
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,290
Don't worry.

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,930
Just do as you're told.

34
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,930
It's just business as usual.

35
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,150
Do you consider yourself a patient person?

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,430
No.

37
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,520
Have you ever seen a UFO?

38
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,850
No.

39
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,440
Do you believe in the existence of God?

40
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,770
No.

41
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,080
Do you know any contractors?

42
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,900
No.

43
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,380
Um, is something wrong?

44
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,260
N-Nothing.

45
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,270
Um, I think...

46
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,270
Didn't I already say everything was fine?

47
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,800
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,900
Is there a problem?

49
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,840
It's nothing.

50
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,400
Next!

51
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,670
You're coming with me.

52
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,670
No, let go!

53
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,620
No! No!

54
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,920
Take her back to testing!

55
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,010
Next!

56
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,450
Yes!

57
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,660
Ghosts aren't a rare sight in here.

58
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,710
Things that exist tend to disappear, while things that don't tend to appear.

59
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,750
Auditory hallucinations and similar occurrences aren't out of the ordinary.

60
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,280
You won't get the job done if you lose composure whenever it happens.

61
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:07,750
Besides, world-renowned scientists are working day and night to solve similar supernatural phenomena in this facility.

62
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,390
Our job is to provide an optimal working environment for them, which isn't an easy thing to do.

63
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:21,150
In any case, you guys aren't allowed to leave this place for the next month without exception.

64
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,730
Even if you die.

65
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,530
If you get the message, answer me!

66
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,750
Sir!

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,100
This is Sector Three,

68
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,870
the most important area we're responsible for.

69
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,480
Standard cleaning duties occur late at night, when research isn't being conducted.

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,030
Hey, you! Are you listening to me?

71
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,010
Yes, I'm sorry.

72
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,910
You don't need to clean that room.

73
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,530
Why not?

74
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,460
The man in charge of that room is notoriously meticulous.

75
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,590
Gentlemen...

76
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,360
Chief Sergei!

77
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,430
Hey! Get out of the way!

78
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,510
You idiot! What are you looking at?

79
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,340
I'm terribly sorry.

80
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,200
Why are you just standing there? Hurry and pick it up!

81
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,550
Okay.

82
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll be going ahead of you.

83
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,120
Y-Yes.

84
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,940
I'm really sorry about this.

85
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,280
I hope you're not hurt.

86
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,030
Yes. Good day.

87
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,580
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,980
We're off to the next one!

89
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:58,790
Equipment room A-3
in 1 hour

90
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,910
Equipment room A-3

91
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,040
Equipment room A-3
in 1 hour

92
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,160
Equipment room A-3
in 1 hour

93
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,290
Equipment room A-3
in 1 hour

94
00:06:59,290 --> 00:06:59,410
Equipment room A-3
in 1 hour

95
00:06:59,410 --> 00:06:59,540
Equipment room A-3
in 1 hour

96
00:06:59,540 --> 00:06:59,660
Equipment room A-3
in 1 hour

97
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,750
Equipment room A-3
in 1 hour

98
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,750
How did you know it was me?

99
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,400
I knew they were sending someone to the sanitation division.

100
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,360
Is there anyone else from the syndicate?

101
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,120
Yes, but I've never met them.

102
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,750
I see.

103
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,010
Listen, I want to tell you something in advance.

104
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,270
Don't rely on me.

105
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,800
I only cooperate with the syndicate so I can conduct research here.

106
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,340
It's the first time I've done this kind of work.

107
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,940
There wasn't any occurrence for two years, and suddenly this happens...

108
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,890
Rest assured. I won't rely on you.

109
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,540
That aside, I want to ask you about the meteor fragment.

110
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,000
What about it?

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,040
Tell me everything you know.

112
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,190
To be honest, the details are unknown.

113
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,240
However, a similar substance was confirmed before the disappearance of South America,

114
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,960
so it's believed that collecting data on it will be invaluable when it comes to solving the mystery behind the gate.

115
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:10,450
I don't know why the CIA is trying to steal it, but...

116
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,490
This isn't part of the job, is it?

117
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,780
Excuse me. If anything else comes up, I'll contact you.

118
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:30,240
Sorry for the late introduction. My name is Mina Khandar Swami.

119
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,940
By the way, that sticker doesn't serve much of a purpose.

120
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,760
There isn't any way to identify a contractor.

121
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,890
Don't touch it.

122
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,210
I'm in the middle of an experiment.

123
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,960
I thought my instructions explicitly stated not to have this room cleaned.

124
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,220
I'm sorry. I noticed it was the same model as the one I used to have.

125
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,720
Satake?

126
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Do you also gaze at the stars?

127
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,590
I did before the stars became what they are now.

128
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,740
Your name?

129
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
Li Shun Sheng.

130
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,520
Li-kun?

131
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,320
Yes.

132
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,210
How would you like to see a real star?

133
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,590
Episode Eleven When One Takes Back What Was Lost Within the Wall... (Part One)

134
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,140
Satake may be new as a domestic manufacturer,

135
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,300
but their products come equipped with an inexpensive, high-performance lens.

136
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,680
There are limits to the magnifying capabilities of an ML800, though.

137
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Did you use a Barlow lens?

138
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,850
No. Compatible lenses were too expensive.

139
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,130
I see. Your wishes will be answered in ten years time, then.

140
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,140
Um... What are you doing?

141
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,440
I'm looking at the stars. What else would I be doing?

142
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,120
But...

143
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,750
Are you going to give up because you know the sky is just a fabrication?

144
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,640
I won't.

145
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,180
My entire life changed when this sky appeared.

146
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,670
I don't have any intention of giving up this hobby of mine, though.

147
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,600
You should take a look.

148
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,670
I can't see anything.

149
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,270
Forget about everything.

150
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,540
Forget that the moon has vanished.

151
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:12,510
Forget about all the rockets that have gone missing beyond the stratosphere.

152
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:20,440
You have to believe that these stars are the ones you were gazing at in the past.

153
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,530
Why?

154
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,380
There was nothing there a moment ago.

155
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,860
We're within the gate.

156
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,850
"The impossible becomes possible" is the best explanation I can come up with at the moment.

157
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,580
The explanation is a little subpar coming from a scientist, isn't it?

158
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,510
I can assert that what you've witnessed is the beginning of a likely scenario for the future of this planet, though.

159
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:06,850
Li-kun, what do you think will happen if everyone in the world experiences what we just did?

160
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:15,250
I have a feeling we'll regain a genuine starry sky when that happens.

161
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,530
You're an honest person.

162
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,870
Your facial expression says "no way".

163
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,800
Well, that's okay.

164
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,760
You should join our group someday.

165
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,800
It only consists of my sister and me, though.

166
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,330
Sister?

167
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,190
Yeah. She can't move her appendages right now, but...

168
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,720
If only for a day,

169
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,200
I want to remove this fabricated sky and take her into outer space.

170
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,930
That's my dream.

171
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,330
That dream... I hope it becomes a reality.

172
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,730
Yeah.

173
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,510
May I sit here?

174
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,990
Is everything all right now?

175
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,930
I can see things that I've lost.

176
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,230
Two, three...

177
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,640
Everywhere.

178
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,040
I've decided to leave this place.

179
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,060
Leave? How?

180
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,020
If I hand it to that man, I'll be able to...

181
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,630
I told you it's none of your business!

182
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,600
How long are you going to chase me?

183
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,490
You're already dead!

184
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,980
Whether I betray the country or Mama, I won't take any more of this from you!

185
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,660
I am who I am!

186
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,070
If you go that far, it might be difficult to return to society.

187
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,080
She's thinking about leaving this place.

188
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,930
Without waiting a month?

189
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,290
How?

190
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,210
Well, I don't know.

191
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,810
Oh.

192
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,610
That's a cause for concern.

193
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,830
What happened?

194
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,300
That crazy woman named Corinna was murdered.

195
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,250
The security camera was out of order when it happened.

196
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,630
Are you sure?

197
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,420
Yes, I saw it with my very own eyes.

198
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,110
It's him.

199
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,670
I heard you two were close.

200
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Too many improbable occurrences have taken place here.

201
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:07,320
For example, a crime of passion involving two people who just met each other.

202
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,200
Did she tell you anything before she was killed?

203
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,630
Nothing.

204
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,350
Keep an eye on him.

205
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,460
Roger!

206
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,640
Yes, it's me.

207
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,550
Was it really not you?

208
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,770
I had no reason to kill her.

209
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,480
Do you need one,

210
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,090
even if you're a contractor?

211
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,600
Is that all you had to say?

212
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,120
If you have no further business...

213
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,640
Could you be... upset?

214
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,580
I'm sorry. I'm surprised.

215
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,430
I thought contractors were people who lost their emotions.

216
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,760
If you didn't do it, then who...

217
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,980
There I go again. I'm sorry, I was out of line.

218
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,320
You can make all the assumptions you want,

219
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,480
but don't act on your own.

220
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,550
That is... If you want to continue with your research. Is that clear?

221
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,590
Y-Yes.

222
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,410
The female victim was a courier sent by the CIA.

223
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,940
She was planning on handing us the meteor fragment in exchange for her release from the facility.

224
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,190
Unfortunately, she didn't mention its location.

225
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,490
I understand. I'll do my best.

226
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,740
We will now commence an area search using the surveillance camera operated by Dr. Sergei's Third Sector team.

227
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,640
All personnel with corresponding ID numbers, please proceed to Conference Room Two.

228
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:23,760
Within the premises, a phenomenon observed by different people will result in a myriad of experiences.

229
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,640
The reason I asked you to come here is to gather as much observational data as possible.

230
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,680
Let me know exactly what you see, hear, and feel.

231
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,150
The interrogation must have been tough.

232
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,110
Nick-san.

233
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,320
I know the feeling. I've experienced it myself.

234
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,860
Don't worry, I'm on your side.

235
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,390
You're not the type of person that can kill people.

236
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,010
It's time. Begin the search.

237
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,410
The surveillance camera is now in motion.

238
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:16,440
It will soon pass Chiyoda Ward, Kanda 3-chome, and head toward Chuo-dori Avenue.

239
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,940
Stop it right there.

240
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,460
Can you zoom in just beyond that car?

241
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,460
It looks like we'll have to rewrite the map again.

242
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,540
Return and travel on the west route.

243
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,660
Did you see that?

244
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,610
Yes, definitely.

245
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,590
Right there!

246
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,510
Play it in slow motion from here.

247
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,720
Right there!

248
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,100
Lancernopt synchrotron radiation?

249
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,730
My, my... This is...

250
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,640
The meteor fragment?

251
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,210
Within the gate, you can retrieve what you once lost.

252
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,540
What was seen inside the green mist was either a demon or a cursed remnant from the past.

253
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,760
The irrevocable past is a bloody memory.

254
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,950
The starry sky that disappeared beyond the mirror is the one I saw with you.

255
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,350
Contractors do not dream.

256
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,340
Episode Twelve When One Takes Back What Was Lost Within the Wall... (Part Two)

257
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,350
The remuneration is complete.
