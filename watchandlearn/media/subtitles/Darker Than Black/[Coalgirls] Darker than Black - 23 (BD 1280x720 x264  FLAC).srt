00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,660
Pai! Pai!

3
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,300
Are you all right, Pai?

4
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,630
"Do you know anything about the starry skies of the past?"

5
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,260
"Do you have any memories of them?"

6
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,220
Is this the topic of the questionnaire?

7
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,970
It's a strange topic, isn't it?

8
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,020
It's probably because of the rumor about the stars.

9
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,210
Rumor?

10
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,480
That's right! It's today, isn't it?

11
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,820
You can see the stars of the past for one night. Didn't you know?

12
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,660
Stars of the past?

13
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,990
From midnight until dawn.

14
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:45,200
No way. We're not talking about  happy hour at Kabukicho, you know.

15
00:01:47,310 --> 00:02:07,120
This month's goal

16
00:01:47,310 --> 00:02:07,120
on our loan

17
00:01:47,310 --> 00:02:07,120
Bonus payment

18
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,610
N-n-n-n-no! Excuse me!

19
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,120
In any case, what you want me to do for this brat... I-I mean...

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,770
your son, is conduct a survey, correct?

21
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:02,520
Even these kinds of extra credit  assignments can affect his grades.

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,530
The more the better, as far as this assignment is concerned.

23
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,980
Other children will probably collect ten replies at most.

24
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,360
So let's make it fifty... no, a hundred for my child.

25
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,610
Okay...

26
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,900
Obtain a hundred replies for this questionnaire.

27
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,570
Well, about that...

28
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,280
I'll pay 100,000 yen.

29
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,750
Just because it's a child's homework assignment  doesn't mean it's acceptable for my Yoshihiro-chan to lose.

30
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,420
Even so, homework should be done by yourse...

31
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,020
We'll get a hundred responses!  Let us take care of this assignment!

32
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,400
Leave it to the Kurasawa Detective Agency!

33
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,820
I hope you didn't have a personal relationship with November 11.

34
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,780
Nothing aside from a professional one.

35
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,430
Decade had good reason to be concerned.  There's little doubt November 11 was a member of the E.P.R.

36
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,210
Did the E.P.R. have any motive to kill Decade?

37
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:16,390
This case is no longer within our jurisdiction.

38
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,550
Don't probe into this matter any further.

39
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,510
Actions taken by PANDORA were rather aggressive the other day,

40
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,640
very uncharacteristic of a research facility.

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,980
Since when has PANDORA...

42
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,970
Didn't you hear what I said, Kirihara?

43
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,480
This case is out of our jurisdiction.

44
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,820
It was simply another case involving the death of a contractor.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,090
He was...

46
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,400
He was someone who took pride in himself.

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,870
Whether he was a contractor or not had nothing to do with it.

48
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,110
His last words were...

49
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,850
"Do what you believe is right."

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,670
Excuse me.

51
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,210
Wait! Did he contact you?

52
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,460
That was just a joke.

53
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,180
That area in South America has been  off-limits ever since the incident occurred.

54
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,090
The only thing we know for sure is  that massive warfare broke out around it,

55
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,040
which was on the scale of a world war.

56
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,170
During the conflict,  myriads of contractors were deployed as weapons.

57
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,040
Hei and Amber were among them.

58
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,950
They were assigned by the same syndicate.

59
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,560
It was said that Hei wasn't a contractor when he earned his reputation as the Grim Reaper.

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,720
Is that true?

61
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,210
There was another contractor who was widely feared, though.

62
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,170
The one named Pai, Hei's sister.

63
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,320
Is she still in the middle of her remuneration?

64
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,350
You two are always together. You look like lovers.

65
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,190
Are you gazing at the stars again?

66
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,550
Only because I don't have anything else to do.

67
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,990
No matter how long you stare at them,  you won't be able to see the stars of the past.

68
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,950
Yes. According to Schroeder,

69
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,430
Secret line

70
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,970
Secret line

71
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,510
Secret line

72
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:48,970
Secret line

73
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,850
the light emitted by the masked contractor

74
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,020
and the light observed prior to the  disappearance of the gate in South America

75
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,220
are believed to be the one in the same.

76
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,750
Light, you say?

77
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,300
Yeah, it was an intense light.

78
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,840
I've never seen anything like it.

79
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,680
I realized why Amber needs Hei.

80
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,550
She wants to replicate what happened in South America,

81
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,180
and she probably needs Hei's power to do it.

82
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,850
Are you saying there's a connection between Hei  and the disappearance of the South American gate?

83
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,740
Hey, wait a minute. If what you say is true...

84
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,320
The contractor's identity has been confirmed to be BK201.

85
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,920
Yes, I've already made the  arrangements for the elimination of his unit.

86
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,420
The stars of the past?

87
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,290
Yes, the stars from the distant past.

88
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,380
Anything is fine.  Please try to recall anything that comes to mind.

89
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,410
Stars are stars.

90
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,190
I can't tell the difference between  the stars of the past and the present.

91
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,320
}Sir, do you have something to add?

92
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,260
Anything about the stars or the night skies of the past is fine.

93
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,950
You're wasting your time on him.

94
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,360
He's not the talkative type.

95
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,570
I get nostalgic whenever I think  about the night of the Giacobinids.

96
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,500
It's been thirty years.

97
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,900
No... Since Toshikyuki was still in elementary school back then, it's been longer than that.

98
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,910
Don't you remember?

99
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,430
He insisted on watching the meteor shower,  so I drove him out in the middle of the night.

100
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,640
We waited for quite a while, but we never saw it that evening.

101
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,670
In the end, he fell asleep.

102
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,800
To those of you who plan to go outside soon,

103
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,420
No, I haven't made any plans.

104
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,420
Rie has some tips for you.

105
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:34,300
Although it's still overcast, showers are expected later in  the evening, so make sure to bring an umbrella with you.

106
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,940
I just don't have the time to be gazing at the stars.

107
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,750
It looks like it might be called off.  The forecast says it's going to rain.

108
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,720
The skies aren't going to be clear?  We won't be able to see the stars of the past, will we?

109
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,020
Do you believe in it, too?

110
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,460
Well, who knows?

111
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,000
Not that rumor again.

112
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,160
Come to think of it, I do have some memories of the stars.

113
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,930
What kind of memories? Something romantic?

114
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,310
No, nothing like that.

115
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,220
Do you remember when you were about this tall?

116
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,980
You got lost in an amusement park.

117
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,880
By the time I found you, it was already dark.

118
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,260
I was scared to death, but you kept a straight face and said,

119
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,810
"I was watching the stars".

120
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,890
You're kidding! I was really cute, wasn't I?

121
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,270
You sure were.  That happened while your mother was still well.

122
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,630
That was a pretty horrible attempt  at tailing somebody, Saitou, Kouno.

123
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,870
What's the meaning of this? Who ordered you to do it?

124
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,590
Er... That's...

125
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,280
If you were ordered to follow me,  you should have asked Ohtsuka to do it in your place.

126
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,480
B-Boss!

127
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,380
Li-kun?

128
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,260
Wait!

129
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,340
U-Um... Are you hungry by any chance?

130
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,590
Episode Twenty-Three

131
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,590
God is In His Heaven...

132
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,400
Did I look that hungry to you?

133
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,170
Well, sort of. You looked like someone I knew.

134
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,700
Did I look like the criminal you're looking for?

135
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,140
I was right, just as I thought.

136
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,550
That's...

137
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,210
Don't move.

138
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,470
Someone's trying to snipe you from the seats in the aft.

139
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,810
Come on. That wasn't convincing at all.

140
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,550
Is that so?

141
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,690
Because...

142
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,690
It's a strange feeling.  When you've chased suspects for as long as I have,

143
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,100
you develop an attachment to what you do.

144
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,750
Always on the job, aren't you?

145
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,340
It's true that I've put in a lot of time,

146
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,630
but after a while,  you become another face in the crowd to the organization.

147
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,140
It feels like I've lost a part of my identity.

148
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,070
Every organization is the same.

149
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,600
They treat you like a pawn and exploit you at will.

150
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,020
You might be right.

151
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,610
Like I said, it's not that I can't pay the bill.

152
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,280
I'm just short on cash right now, so I'll pay you later.

153
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,200
Sir, your name is on our blacklist.

154
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,380
If I recall, you pulled the same stunt last year.

155
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,110
You must be kidding!  You must have mistaken me for someone else!

156
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:30,300
Right. There's no way my boss could  afford to come to a place like this very often.

157
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,460
No way! Are you serious?

158
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,670
I'm shocked. I didn't know you liked middle-aged women!

159
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,930
M-Middle-aged...

160
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,640
Well, if it isn't Li-kun! Your timing couldn't have been better.

161
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,170
Stars?

162
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,250
Yeah, any memories about the stars of the past.

163
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,280
People sure like to talk about them.

164
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,730
Memories tend to become exaggerated.

165
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,470
Well, taking the emergence of the gate and everything else into consideration,

166
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,320
I suppose it's a result of their insecurity.

167
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,030
Insecurity?

168
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,530
The recent terrorist attack, for example.

169
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:12,850
People appear to be calm and collected,  but I'm sure they're insecure about the present,

170
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,240
which is why they rely on their memories.

171
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,050
This is where we part ways.

172
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,430
You saved my ass. Thanks for the meal.

173
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,610
What do you mean by that?  Make sure you pay me back.

174
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,260
Thanks.

175
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,570
Isn't it a wonderful sight?

176
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,880
Yeah.

177
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,270
How do you feel about this city? Do you like it?

178
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,980
Well, it's not that I don't like it.

179
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,070
It's moderately indifferent,

180
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,560
yet moderately warm.

181
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,660
I wasn't supposed to stay here as long as I have,

182
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,940
but now I wish I could make it my home.

183
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,940
I see. This city is getting more violent by the day, though.

184
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,980
This city is serene

185
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,290
compared to the tragedy my sister and I lived through.

186
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,020
Were you in a combat zone?

187
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,080
How about your sister? Is she still there?

188
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,020
No, she isn't.

189
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,980
Did she pass away?

190
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,230
That must have been a sad moment.

191
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,540
I wonder about that.

192
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,070
A part of me might have felt relieved.

193
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,380
Have you heard about the rumor?

194
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,620
I have, but I don't think it's going to happen.

195
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,220
I didn't think anyone would believe it, but...

196
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,500
Oh, look.

197
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,970
Do you think we'll be able to see it?

198
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,010
Dad!

199
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,390
Is everyone going to wait until the skies  clear up just to catch a glimpse of the stars?

200
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,760
Do you want to see the stars of the past?

201
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,220
I do, but I want to show it to others even more.

202
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,220
It won't happen unless the stars  of the present fade away, though.

203
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,800
They weren't real to begin with.

204
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,630
True, but if those stars were to disappear all at once,

205
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,310
I think it'd be sad in its own way.

206
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,820
I have to go. I'm glad we were able to talk.

207
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,920
I was thinking about too many things  and wasn't sure about what I was doing.

208
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,280
When you're not sure about something, you should just trust your intuition.

209
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,320
Was it something I said?

210
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,210
No, you're right.

211
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,090
Thanks for keeping me company. I had fun.

212
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,340
Me, too.

213
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,310
I'll see you around.

214
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,270
Onii-chan...

215
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,080
I made the stars fall again.

216
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,530
There were so many... today...

217
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,610
Hei, it's over.

218
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,510
Let's go back.

219
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,740
Oh, no. It's starting to rain.

220
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,930
I told you we wouldn't be able to see them.

221
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,400
Weren't you looking up at the sky a minute ago?

222
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,870
Don't be ridiculous.

223
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,440
Detectives have to be realistic in order to do their jobs, Kiko.

224
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,250
Whether the stars disappear or a weird gate appears,

225
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,010
no matter how many changes occur in the  environment, people won't change how they live their lives.

226
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,420
Boss, you're pretty cool today, aren't you?

227
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,220
Don't fall for me, Kiko.

228
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,070
All's right with the world, huh?

229
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,380
Hei, stay away from your apartment!

230
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,030
What happened?

231
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,530
Don't ask!

232
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,370
Get in!

233
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,290
Huang!

234
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,130
It looks like we were thrown out of the syndicate.

235
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,140
What? Why?

236
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,690
That's what I'd like to know.

237
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,060
Hei, about the disappearance of the gate in South America...

238
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,240
Are you hiding something from us?

239
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,440
No hard feelings, BK201.

240
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,460
I'm just following orders.

241
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,810
A manipulator of gravity, huh?

242
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,900
Supernaturals with power tend to get  cocky and forget about their surroundings.

243
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,090
You're...

244
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,620
Hey, take it easy. There's no need to panic.

245
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,540
I was sent by Amber as a messenger.

246
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,450
We'll be waiting for you inside the gate, BK201.

247
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,610
Bullshit! It isn't a place you can enter that easily.

248
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,860
That's why I shall act as your guide.

249
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,210
Did you think we'd fall for that?

250
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,120
Very well.

251
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,670
Hei?

252
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,890
I don't know what happened at Heaven's Gate,

253
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,180
including the reason why my sister Pai disappeared.

254
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,250
Amber's the only one who knows.

255
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,080
That's why...

256
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,500
you want to find out for yourself.

257
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,160
Do it.

258
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,640
Meet with Amber and talk to her.

259
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,320
Huang!

260
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,470
Hop in.

261
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,850
I'll take you as far as I can.

262
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,670
Why?  Why are our superiors mobilizing without notifying us first?

263
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,230
There was a possibility of some kind of intervention.

264
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,900
Intervention?

265
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,390
Don't tell me...

266
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,840
Dad?

267
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,170
Dad, what is it? I'm a little busy right now.

268
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,390
Evacuate as soon as you can, Misaki!

269
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,500
Evacuate?

270
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,220
I'll explain the details later.

271
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,990
Leave Tokyo at once!

272
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,050
What's going on? Don't tell me...

273
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,020
whatever happened in South  America is about to take place here...

274
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,820
At the moment, we have two primary objectives:

275
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,110
Lead the dolls into the gate,

276
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,410
and destroy the particle accelerator.

277
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,210
Let's go.

278
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,020
It's almost here, the beginning of the end.

279
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,620
Twinkle, twinkle, sparkle, sparkle,

280
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,680
the stars shine, and fall to the ground.

281
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,490
Boom, boom, the place where they fall

282
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,230
is inside a mist, where nothing can be seen.

283
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,860
The mist inside men's minds.

284
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,610
Just wait until you see what is there.

285
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,350
Episode Twenty-Four Meteor Shower...
