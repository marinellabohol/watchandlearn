2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,150
Do you need a receipt?

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,220
Yes, please.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,370
Who should I address it to?

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,120
British Secret Intelligence Service.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,060
Yes... Secret?

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,090
You can use the initials.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,690
Oh, don't write MI6, though.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,890
Write SIS instead.

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,630
You sure like to joke around.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,080
That aside, you're quite the drinker.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,180
I always get an urge to drink after work.

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,190
That night club's a joke. How can they employ hosts that get drunk before a customer does?

14
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,200
Geez.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,670
Sorry!

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,260
Pick up the phone, November.

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,170
Thank you for calling. This is your beloved Jack Simon.

18
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,250
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.

19
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,300
Let me leave you with a joke instead.

20
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,750
The shepherd said to the minister, "My wife is..."

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,320
This is April. I've found February, our top priority.

22
00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:00,120
Kabuki Street - Best in town

23
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,370
How is she?

24
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,820
She'll live. She hasn't regained consciousness yet.

25
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,020
Is the rumor about her appearance in Tokyo true?

26
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,310
You have one saved message.

27
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,390
This is April. I've found February, our top priority.

28
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,390
She's being accompanied by a Caucasian boy with heterochromatic eyes.

29
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,430
Where to?

30
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,520
Follow the car ahead of us.

31
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,140
4:04 A.M. End of messages.

32
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:01,540
I thought about making a visit here after attending a funeral for an old navy friend in Hong Kong.

33
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:10,130
February, huh? Who would have thought she'd appear right in front of us after she went missing for five years?

34
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,660
Who was accompanying her?

35
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,480
The details, including the cause of the explosion, are unknown.

36
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,450
There's a saying in this country that goes "there's no use crying over spilt milk".

37
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,980
There's nothing we can do about the fact that she was a double agent who stole gate-related information from us

38
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,070
and gave it to that syndicate.

39
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:40,390
We also can't do anything about the fact that Great Britain lost an advantage in contractor-related research because of her.

40
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:47,740
There's nothing we can do about what was spilt, but we can punish the maid who's responsible.

41
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,560
Why now, of all times?

42
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,390
Do you think her appearance and the upcoming solar maximum are related in any way?

43
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,980
I wouldn't know.

44
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,110
Suspend all other duties and prioritize the apprehension of February.

45
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,970
Solar maximum?

46
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:22,930
Once every few years, the largest sunspots, classified by their Zurich number, appear in clusters on the surface of the sun.

47
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,550
It looks like a gigantic eyeball.

48
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,950
Eyeball? That sounds creepy.

49
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,930
This phenomenon wasn't observed before the emergence of the gate,

50
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,400
so there's been a tense atmosphere around the observatory for the past few days.

51
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,440
Is something going to happen?

52
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,610
Something might happen, but something might not.

53
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,820
There hasn't been any recent activity considered to be related. To be honest, I don't know.

54
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,600
There's something that's been bothering me, though.

55
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:58,110
Five years ago, during the last solar maximum, the gate in South America disappeared.

56
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,860
"Please protect your smile."

57
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,770
Why?

58
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,050
No, I must express gratitude in these kinds of situations.

59
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,980
Thank you,

60
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,270
and nice to meet you.

61
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,720
Nice to meet you. I'm Li Shun Sheng.

62
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,460
I'm Maki.

63
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,650
Was that a gift from someone?

64
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,200
I received it from somebody important to me.

65
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,440
I see. You should take good care of it.

66
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,970
What was it doing in a place like that?

67
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you.

68
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,170
Who would have thought District 45 would be targeted?

69
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,880
Targeted?

70
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:09,990
According to information from an informant in forensics, not even a sliver of the meteor fragment could be found.

71
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,870
Who did it?

72
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,630
Footprints of a MI6 agent were left on the scene.

73
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,330
The same agent we came into contact with during the Havoc mission.

74
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,980
Retrieve it.

75
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,240
Why would MI6 do that?

76
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,170
There aren't any limits of restraint as far as PANDORA is concerned.

77
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:42,610
In other words, it's a melting pot of countries with their own priorities.

78
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,820
I wouldn't be surprised if news about the stolen meteor fragment already reached the U.K.

79
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,370
What were you thinking, returning to the scene of the crime?

80
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,140
I lost something important.

81
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,270
It landed in a tree during the explosion.

82
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,040
Amagiri, I met an interesting person.

83
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,180
He was nice to me.

84
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,410
For some reason, it felt strange.

85
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,500
Who was it?

86
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,590
I don't know.

87
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,860
Were you being followed?

88
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,060
Everything's fine.

89
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,840
We've obtained the meteor fragment.

90
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,810
We'll leave this town in a state of chaos and animosity.

91
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,060
Let's begin.

92
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,250
Where's Amber?

93
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,330
Where did she go?

94
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,540
She left to look for the final key.

95
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,660
Final key?

96
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,530
In that case, I'll also...

97
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,600
You don't have to go.

98
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,980
Why not?

99
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:04,840
Is she meeting with someone, by chance?

100
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,070
That'll be 480 yen.

101
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,580
Episode Fifteen

102
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,580
Memories of Betrayal

103
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,580
in an Amber Smile...

104
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,580
(Part One)

105
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,820
Of course,

106
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,770
just because the solar maximum is occurring doesn't mean the phenomenon that took place in South America will occur here.

107
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,810
That's true,

108
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,030
or Tokyo would have disappeared several times.

109
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,370
However, I do consider it to be one of the indicators for preliminary activity.

110
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,640
If multiple, simultaneous occurrences are confirmed...

111
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,650
Are there any other indicators?

112
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:15,260
For example, during the last solar maximum that led to the disappearance of the South American gate, Hoshimi-sama...

113
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,070
Chief Ishizaki! Chief Ishizaki! Please return to the observation room immediately.

114
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,450
The stars are whispering.

115
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,180
The stars are whispering.

116
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,330
Happily, sorrowfully...

117
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,320
Glittering, shimmering...

118
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,890
I can hear it.

119
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,730
I can hear it.

120
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,660
Hoshimi-sama spoke...

121
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,940
No way! Saitou-san, that's...

122
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,530
Yeah, the Kanei Trade Building,

123
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,660
where MI6's Tokyo branch is located.

124
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,580
The floor housing the British Intelligence Service was targeted.

125
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,910
It seems like they're growing restless.

126
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,990
Information about their initial course of action has been leaked all the way down to us.

127
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,160
Apparently, there were traces of CIA involvement.

128
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,290
That can't be.

129
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,970
Excuse us.

130
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,200
Lieutenant Kirihara Misaki, Chief of Foreign Affairs, Division Four, at your...

131
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,790
Mr. Nishijima?

132
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,310
Treat what I'm about to tell you as off the record.

133
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:40,440
Three weeks ago, a certain prohibited material was smuggled from the gate.

134
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,350
A CIA agent was believed to have been initially involved,

135
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,700
but the people who smuggled it were from another organization.

136
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,430
MI6.

137
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,200
That's what the CIA is speculating.

138
00:11:53,780 --> 00:12:02,400
The U.K. suddenly lost any advantage it once had regarding contractor-related research as a result of the information leak.

139
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,470
They have been visibly apprehensive in recent years.

140
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,560
Did the CIA blow up the MI6 branch in order to retrieve the gate-proprietary material?

141
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,120
That is only an assumption.

142
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,190
First MI6, and now the CIA building?

143
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,750
Don't tell me the English retaliated.

144
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,430
That's not it. It looks like a different intelligence agency has been interfering.

145
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,600
What's going on?

146
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,830
Who knows? Maybe all of them are trying to start a war.

147
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,730
Shinjyuku Shaken!! Reoccurring explosions of buildings a mystery.

148
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,170
Another explosion took place at the Pacific Central Tower, which occurred after the attack on the Kanei Trade Building.

149
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,730
Many survivors are still trapped inside the tower, unable to escape due to the ensuing fire.

150
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:10,990
I'm sorry!

151
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,060
Who was responsible for it this time?

152
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,130
I'm still waiting for the report from an undercover agent conducting espionage on the CIA.

153
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,750
I'm going to stop by the American embassy.

154
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,720
Continue with the search and apprehension of February.

155
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,050
Forget about periodic updates. Call me when there's some kind of progress.

156
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,270
Understood.

157
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,490
Give it back.

158
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,620
What are you talking about?

159
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,050
The stolen meteor fragment.

160
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,860
"I don't know what you're talking about, ask somebody else" is what I should be telling you,

161
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,380
but that aside, welcome.

162
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,240
I also have something I need to ask you.

163
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,740
Where's February?

164
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,830
My information says she's in Tokyo.

165
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,140
Her code name within your organization is Amber, isn't it?

166
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,460
Amber is... in this city?

167
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,840
I bet the Shinjuku explosion this morning was her work,

168
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,150
since it was confirmed by one of our agents.

169
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,920
Did the agent see her?

170
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,030
She was a victim of the explosion and is in critical condition as a result.

171
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,020
Tell me where she is now!

172
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,450
I'm the one who's asking!

173
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,670
The fact that she's a member of your organization is more than...

174
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,960
It can't be.

175
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,590
Were you also deceived by her?

176
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,970
She's pretty bold for a cute girl.

177
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,720
A Lilith in disguise.

178
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,460
Why did Amber show up in Tokyo?

179
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,730
What do you think?

180
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,340
Don't lay a hand on her.

181
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,170
I'll take care of her!

182
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,480
Not so fast!

183
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,660
This is November. I need the latest information on the bombing of the CIA building.

184
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:29,210
According to the undercover agent, there were traces of activity from the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

185
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,080
The next target is the Chinese embassy, huh?

186
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,430
They're leaving an easy trail to follow.

187
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,680
Although we don't know their objectives, this works out in our favor.

188
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,020
She's being accompanied by a Caucasian boy with heterochromatic eyes.

189
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,530
Heterochromia...

190
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,210
If anything happens, be sure to contact her.

191
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,090
Where's February?

192
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,180
Code name Amber. Where is she?

193
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,870
I won't tell you.

194
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,470
I guess I don't have any other choice but to force you to tell me.

195
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,180
We have no need for him if he was defeated that easily.

196
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,560
Use three recorders and get a backup ready, just in case.

197
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,870
Set the auxiliary organic media to recordable temperature.

198
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,600
Don't cut off the power.

199
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,490
Oh, set up a connection with the Crisis Management Center in the Prime Minister's Office.

200
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,130
Okay.

201
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,490
Ishizaki-san.

202
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,880
This is the second time I've heard Hoshimi-sama speak.

203
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,250
The first time was during the solar maximum five years ago.

204
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,120
That was when...

205
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,420
Yes, when part of South America disappeared from the world as we knew it.

206
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:25,290
Shiny and bright, the stars are twinkling.

207
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,720
Strong and weak, they are singing.

208
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,000
I can hear it, just like that time.

209
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,710
It's almost here.

210
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,910
The beginning of the end.

211
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,650
The beginning of the end.

212
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,600
I can't find the bread knife.

213
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,370
Can I use it?

214
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,240
I like the smell of freshly baked bread,

215
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,640
spread with a generous serving of lime marmalade and topped with whipped cream.

216
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,890
Should we run away?

217
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,310
Somewhere... Somewhere far away.

218
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,270
You, Pai, and me, the three of us.

219
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,210
Where to?

220
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,160
A place where we can see the stars.

221
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,320
Thanks.

222
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,690
It's a good luck charm.

223
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,780
"Please protect your smile."

224
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,670
What? She appeared in Tokyo?

225
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,440
Are you sure it's Amber, Hei?

226
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,160
That bastard.

227
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,060
Maybe Yin knows where she is.

228
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,200
Hey, Mao!

229
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,950
It may sound strange coming from me,

230
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,970
Tobacco

231
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,190
but I really like this name.

232
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,710
Amber.

233
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,410
Yes. Nice to meet you, Yin.

234
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,290
It's been a while.

235
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,110
Amber...

236
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,960
The familiar name called out is silenced by a vengeful blade.

237
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,970
Trembling about a significant loss, crying over an irretrievable dream.

238
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,450
Revenge is the bread that sustains life.

239
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,750
Sorrow is a poisonous spice.

240
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,160
Envy, fear, and misunderstanding...

241
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,260
The unleashed trap is in the form of a human soul,

242
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,350
Episode Sixteen Memories of Betrayal in an Amber Smile... (Part Two)

243
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,690
and something is on the verge of change.
