00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,180
Hey, talk about a reversal of fortunes, huh?

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,120
What was that?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,490
Night of Miracles

5
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,540
She can't see you?

6
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,760
What does that even mean?

7
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,340
Well, how should I explain?

8
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,500
Oh, an old fortune teller with the traveling
entertainers used to say that...

9
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,370
Um, those with a rigid
world view can't see fae.

10
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,270
I think that was it...

11
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,340
I see.

12
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,770
A rigid world view, huh?

13
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,690
Guts!

14
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,940
I know.

15
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,710
Here they come.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,820
My allies?

17
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,890
What?

18
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,820
What's happening?

19
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,610
Take a good look, with wide-open eyes.

20
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,060
They're miracles, sent to this world by God,

21
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,740
that you can't see just by worshiping an idol.

22
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,620
I see it now.

23
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,610
What is that?

24
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,390
That's where I was headed to begin with.

25
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,590
Though there's been lots of interference.

26
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,780
What's there?

27
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,270
Didn't you want to know what I was after?

28
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,000
Eh?

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,110
It's just as well.

30
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,500
I'll tell you now.

31
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,550
That is...

32
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,430
The estate of Count Lansdown,
who governed Midland's western outskirts.

33
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,000
Loving hunting and hounds, he built this
manse at which to while away his idleness.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,530
The fire five years ago, which killed
the count and his retainers,

35
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,610
should have reduced it to mere ruins...

36
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,370
Come to think of it,

37
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,910
reports said that travelers and pilgrims
often go missing in these parts.

38
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,850
What a sad end for the former hounds.

39
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,330
They're excited by the smell of blood.

40
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,250
Impossible.

41
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,690
How can such things...

42
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,820
...even exist?

43
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,490
That's why I called them miracles.

44
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,850
How can you be terrified of
such a great opportunity?

45
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,110
As a believer, don't you have some phrase?

46
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,960
You could say, "Dear God..."

47
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,270
I've had my fill of miracles.

48
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,270
Enough to make me puke.

49
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,930
Come with me, or you'll be devoured!

50
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,290
Where am I?

51
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,660
Man, that was tough...

52
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,520
What, you even brought the horse?

53
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,770
Hey, Guts!

54
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,560
You seem not to have gotten
it through your skull—

55
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,280
Yeah, I know...

56
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,430
I'll never forget that you brought
me all the way here, horse.

57
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,550
Very good.

58
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,980
Man, those are a lot of heads.

59
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,580
Humans, I tell you...

60
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,480
Oh, Divine Lord, show mercy.

61
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,010
What's wrong?

62
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,990
Oh, nothing really.

63
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,100
What in the world is this?

64
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,160
What misshapen, abhorrent creatures...

65
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,010
Does this have to do with what
Revelations foretold, as well?

66
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,510
Serpico?

67
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,520
Don't!

68
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,530
That idiot!

69
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,220
A man?

70
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,210
Who are you?

71
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,380
That's my line.

72
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,800
I am this place's keeper of the hounds.

73
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,830
Very well...

74
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,310
First, untie me!

75
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,680
I'll see that you are rewarded
handsomely for your aid!

76
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,850
I am...

77
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,700
I am in this state for reasons I cannot say,

78
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,130
but I am a legitimate Holy See knight.

79
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,890
I will ensure you are well-received.

80
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,620
Meat...

81
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,740
What?

82
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,190
It's easier to eat the way it is...

83
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,750
H-H-Hounds!

84
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,730
Don't be cruel to the hounds!

85
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,910
They're my... my family.

86
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,370
Don't hurt them!

87
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,500
You... You'll pay for this!

88
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,150
Even the master of the house...

89
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,510
is fed to the dogs if he... if he is cruel to them!

90
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,520
You killed the master of the house?

91
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,730
No, I ate him.

92
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,040
I... I haven't smelled anything
this good in a long time.

93
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,610
A high-quality noblewoman...

94
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,080
I kn-know... y-your smell...

95
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,270
That was the best prey.

96
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,580
You are a survivor from that day?

97
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,300
I won't be lame and try to
go easy with my injuries.

98
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,390
I couldn't care less if my arm gets ripped off.

99
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,190
For the first time in a long while, I remember

100
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,490
how it felt at the start of all this.

101
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,500
Thanks, it feels like crap.

102
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,040
Me... Me, too.

103
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,600
Thanks.

104
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,430
See, he's finally here.

105
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,850
My target, the one you
wanted to know about...

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,200
The Apostle.

107
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,860
Apostle?

108
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,890
That's right.

109
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,010
Eradicating every last one of these Apostles...

110
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,520
That is my goal.

111
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,790
Th-The moment that brand marked you...

112
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,220
Your... Your fate was set in stone.

113
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,080
You're just p-prey... meat... hunted...

114
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,770
s-struggling... crawling!

115
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,350
Like I said...

116
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,240
Don't be cruel to the hounds!

117
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,970
Guts, above you!

118
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,800
Right!

119
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,870
What's wrong with you, Guts?!

120
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,220
Do it like usual!

121
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,590
Meat... Meat!

122
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,960
Meat... Meat...

123
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm tough and taste like shit...

124
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,650
It'll be fine.

125
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,240
After eating you,

126
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,200
I'll c-cleanse my palate...
with the woman-meat.

127
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,830
Th-That woman... is like the lady.

128
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,960
A noblewoman...

129
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,300
So soft.

130
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,230
M-Melting in your mouth...

131
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,030
The lady?

132
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,520
Th-The flavors are coming out.

133
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,280
Humans who oppose us...

134
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,800
are just food.

135
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,760
I gotta say, when it comes to eating,
you have no table manners.

136
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,350
Yeah.

137
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,020
M-Meat has high... and low grades...

138
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:14,400
People nice to me have... s-soft, sweet meat.

139
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,430
M-Meat from those... who call me ugly...
a-and inferior is low-grade!

140
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,660
Smelly meat... tough meat...

141
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,650
Then I doubt I'd taste good.

142
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,840
No hurry.

143
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,710
I'll know soon enough!

144
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,630
Hey, Guts!

145
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,840
Th-This is real.

146
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,130
This is a real, preserved human being!

147
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,970
Don't touch her!

148
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,640
Don't...

149
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,820
Don't touch the lady!

150
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,180
My lady!

151
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,080
Sh-She believed in me.

152
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,460
They looked down... on me

153
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,180
as ugly and inferior.

154
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:04,970
The lady was the only one...
who believed me, and I...

155
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,860
M-My lady!

156
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,100
So you dressed up the half-eaten
remains as a tribute to her?

157
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,520
Talk about twisted to the core.

158
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,820
Guts...

159
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,660
I will eradicate every last Apostle.

160
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,520
I'll give you a clean death, so talk.

161
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,020
How can I find them?

162
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,650
Them?

163
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,210
The God Hand.

164
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,410
I... I don't know!

165
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,720
I know nothing about them.

166
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,830
They are special...

167
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,880
R-Really, I d-don't know!

168
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,730
I said I don't know!

169
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,070
I don't understand.

170
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,100
I can't think of anything!

171
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,910
Not even a single prayer!

172
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,700
I... I don't... know...

173
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,950
I see.

174
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,890
I'll ride this horse!

175
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,730
Nope.

176
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,090
I'll ride woman.

177
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,740
Female. Meat.

178
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,340
Delicious!

179
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,710
No!

180
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,300
Don't run around if you want to live.

181
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,370
Ye...

182
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,570
Yes.

183
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,320
I'm just running around,

184
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,190
trembling with fear.

185
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,490
I couldn't even beseech God.

186
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,510
And I call myself His servant...

187
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,990
I've said His name a million times.

188
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,210
But I am only

189
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,860
weak,

190
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,750
wretched,

191
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,770
and powerless.

192
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,710
Just powerless?

193
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,650
Just powerless, so you are innocent?

194
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,470
Don't deceive yourself with pretty words.

195
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,060
Within you lies

196
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,120
a dark desire you cannot tell anyone else about.

197
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,580
You felt it...

198
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,790
You felt a dismal lust as you struck that man.

199
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,690
That wasn't the only time...

200
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,800
Even when whipping yourself
in the name of atonement,

201
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,250
you found pleasure within that agony...

202
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,850
There is no God in any of it.

203
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,400
This festering desire is the only truth.

204
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,530
God is too far removed from the likes of you.

205
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,230
Guts...

206
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,630
Hey.

207
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,700
What do you think you're doing?

208
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,080
Guts, she's...

209
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,600
You let yourself get possessed...

210
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,860
Pull this sword up very slowly...

211
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,110
Feel it with me... This pleasure.

212
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,430
Slowly tear me apart.

213
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,610
No!

214
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,010
Hey, you...

215
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,240
Kill him.

216
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,750
Kill that man.

217
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,520
Right now, right here!

218
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,910
Please calm down, Lady Farnese.

219
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,870
I don't know what happened,

220
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,650
but our original mission was
to capture him, remember?

221
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,890
You should avoid being swayed by—

222
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,890
I don't care!

223
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,850
Kill him!

224
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,330
To be blunt, I can't. Not me.

225
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,680
You saw it yourself, Commander.
He has superhuman strength.

226
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,770
I'd just die a meaningless death—

227
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,320
Ow.

228
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,770
Oh, Commander!

229
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,180
There you go, making our commander cry again.

230
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,450
Not my problem.

231
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,380
Well, we shall take our leave.

232
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,120
That is, if you are willing to let us go.

233
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,690
I think I owe you one.

234
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,560
Well, I suppose so.

235
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,080
Heh, fine.

236
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,230
Not a bad move, drawing your sword like that.

237
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,430
I'll say the same.

238
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,160
You are formidable.

239
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,590
So, till we meet again.

240
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:29,940
Hey, wait!

241
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,470
For now, it is farewell.

242
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,730
Same to you, pipsqueak.

243
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,520
What a joker.

244
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:41,950
But you know, I feel kind of
sorry for that Farnese girl.

245
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,430
She's like, all tightly wound.

246
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,940
I'm the one who's wound up.

247
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,950
First a ghost, and now a cleric.

248
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,350
Talk about annoying.

249
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:56,210
Commander, wait for me!

250
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,460
I have to kill him.

251
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,200
I have to.

252
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,190
I have to!

253
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,470
If I don't silence him...

254
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,970
If he continues to live, I...

255
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,310
They saw the same visions in their dreams.

256
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,700
There were villages decimated by disease,

257
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,180
and nations overrun by armies
that commanded giant beasts.

258
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,150
There were cities crushed by earthquakes,

259
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,560
and towns swallowed by floods.

260
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,510
The Sun hidden by a thick, black smoke,

261
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,440
and wandering throngs of starving people.

262
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,440
There were bodies of entire families,
and bodies of their neighbors.

263
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,140
Each saw a myriad of varieties,

264
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,320
but all pointed toward a singular intent.

265
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,000
Each enduring their own night,

266
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,980
the people were trapped in true darkness

267
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,420
that enveloped their shared world.

268
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,750
And amidst the ensuing chaos,

269
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,790
they observed with keen interest

270
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:18,810
a shining hawk, piercing the infinite gloom,

271
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,660
and descending upon the bloodstained land.

272
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,510
They knew immediately

273
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,370
that this was their greatest desire.

274
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,160
Charlotte...

275
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,190
Charlo...

276
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,320
Doctor?

277
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,720
Please bring his relatives.

278
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,780
Quickly, I beg you.

279
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,170
At last...

280
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,410
At long last, we'll have a new queen.

281
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,130
Her Majesty, Queen Charlotte.

282
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,460
Given her nature, she will appoint a regent.

283
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,540
We should plan accordingly...

284
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,470
Do those dolts even
understand what's happening?

285
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,560
It was only thanks to His Majesty

286
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,790
that we survived the war with Chuder.

287
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,750
The hawk...

288
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,390
The hawk will return.

289
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,930
The hawk...

290
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,560
A strange hawk of light that

291
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,680
the people of Windham... nay,
all of Midland saw in dreams.

292
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,150
Though His Majesty was noble and just,

293
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,830
he became inscrutable in many of his
actions after the Battle of Doldrey.

294
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,590
The Band of the Hawk's alleged treason...

295
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,390
Did that really happen?

296
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,380
Your Highness, please open the door!

297
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,330
What is the matter?

298
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,330
General Laban, well,

299
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,980
Her Highness hasn't left her
chambers in five whole days.

300
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,940
Only her favorite lady-in-waiting
is allowed to enter.

301
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,340
She's trying to persuade Her
Highness right now, but...

302
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,340
Your Highness...

303
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,180
Your Highness!

304
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,820
Allow me!

305
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,360
Your Highness,

306
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,090
His Majesty is in critical condition!

307
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,370
Your Highness!

308
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,500
Griffith...

309
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:21,130
Where are... you now?

310
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,760
Father!

311
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,890
His Majesty has passed away.

312
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,320
Now, of all times?

313
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,890
What will happen now?

314
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,870
Please save me, Lord Griffith!

315
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,090
The mountain's moving.

Is Casca alive?

318
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,470
I'll never lose her again.

319
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,430
Come back again, no matter what.

320
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,430
There is something I must do.

321
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,440
You claim it's divine punishment?
