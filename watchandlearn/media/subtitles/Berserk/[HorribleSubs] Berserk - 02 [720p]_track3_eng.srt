2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,980
We finally found you, Black Swordsman!

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,490
Hey, look.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,810
Is that a sword?

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,980
No way...

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,990
How could anyone wield that?

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,490
This man is

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,000
the Hawk of Darkness.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,950
We are the Holy See's Holy Iron Chain Knights.

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,010
We have made haste, by order of
the Miracle Certification Bureau,

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,180
to take you to the Holy See.

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,010
You will not be harmed if you lay
down your sword and surrender.

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,180
If not, we swear upon God
that you will be captured!

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,970
I don't recall doing anything that'd
make a priest arrest me.

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,610
How callous...

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,300
What is all that blood from?

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,500
While tracking you,

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,270
we saw the bodies of a monk,
his daughter, and countless others.

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,780
Guts...

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,190
The time for talk is over!

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,280
This is God's will!

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,700
Troops, capture the Black Swordsman!

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,130
This doesn't look good...

24
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,920
What are you gonna do?

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,140
The Holy Iron Chain Knights

26
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,890
Listen, I'll create an opening.

27
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,740
When I do, race through the forest.

28
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,060
But...

29
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,810
Don't get me wrong!

30
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you really want to die like this,
in the middle of nowhere?

31
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,660
A good blade should rest in a scabbard.

32
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,740
You should return to the master of your sword!

33
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,020
What's his deal?

34
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,340
He can't use his sword at all.

35
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,460
Guts!

36
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,210
I can't get a good grip.

37
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,320
Great!

38
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,720
Have at him!

39
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,800
Idiot, don't kill him!

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,810
H-He's fast...

41
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,640
Stop, you'll kill him.

42
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,260
His false hand! Watch that hand!

43
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,700
Calm down! Don't get worked up!

44
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,560
Surround him! Don't let him move around!

45
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,140
We'll just hit each other...

46
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,090
No!

47
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,000
Idiots! We can't kill him!

48
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,420
The whole lot of you is pathetic...

49
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,920
How can a single fugitive
have you in such disarray?

50
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,850
You can't blame them.

51
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,750
The Holy Iron Chain Knights, also known
as the "Spoiled Brat Knights,"

52
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,780
are full of pampered heirs their
noble families wanted safe.

53
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,760
They're here for the prestige
and safety the order affords.

54
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,950
Most have never fought in a real battle.

55
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,350
Thank you for the lecture.

56
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,170
So, why are you here, Sir Serpico?

57
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,290
Oh, come now...

58
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,750
I'm sure you know.

59
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,990
I became an officer of arms because
I hate the sight of blood—

60
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,570
Good... Now! Secure him!

61
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,800
Oh, crap.

62
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,580
This is the Black Swordsman...

63
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,000
His malice is unmistakable.

64
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,720
He is the one written of in Revelations.

65
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,280
Lady Farnese...

66
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,400
As Serpico stated,

67
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,470
given our troops' combat inexperience,
we face mounting casualties

68
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,660
if we seek to overwhelm him with numbers.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,290
I ask that you allow me, Azan,
to undertake this task!

70
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,220
Back, back!

71
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,420
Back, I say!

72
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,620
Vice-commander...

73
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,380
Sir Azan!

74
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,470
I am Azan, Second-in-Command of
the Holy Iron Chain Knights!

75
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,180
Wow, we'll never run out
of surprises around here.

76
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,920
Iron Staff Demon Azan?

77
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,200
I've heard of you.

78
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,220
I believe you're also called
the Knight of the Bridge.

79
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,150
Oh?

80
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,360
You know this guy, Guts?

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,310
The story goes that an injured old man
was standing on a narrow bridge.

82
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,760
The Knight of the Bridge was a curious guy,

83
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,780
who refused to let an army of
a hundred mounted men pass

84
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,660
because he was protecting that guy.

85
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,030
That was a long time ago.

86
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,920
People laughed and said he could've ended it
by carrying the old man to the other side.

87
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,900
A knight has a duty to uphold
his code of chivalry!

88
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,910
My circumstances led to being a cleric knight.

89
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,820
In any event, I have named myself.

90
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,180
If you are a knight,
courtesy demands you reciprocate!

91
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,870
I'm no knight...

92
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,850
I'm Guts.

93
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,680
Just "Guts," old man.

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,660
Very well, Guts...

95
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,690
Prepare yourself!

96
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,270
He's so old-fashioned.

97
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,400
Prepare to break at least one or two bones!

98
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,860
One or two bones, eh?

99
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,620
I can't keep dodging with this gimpy leg.

100
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,680
And the old man isn't just an idiot
who relies on brute strength.

101
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,000
You nimble trickster!

102
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,210
Summer Showers Thrust!

103
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,220
Vice-commander Azan!

104
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,800
I would commend you.

105
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,310
But given your lack of offense,
your execution lacks finesse.

106
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,130
Your swordsmanship
affirmed its battle-testing.

107
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,280
I'll admit it thrilled me,
hearkening to my own past.

108
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,630
I must apply myself to the order
with greater diligence,

109
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,700
to mend my foolish ways.

110
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,360
Shit...

111
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,450
I can barely feel my limbs anymore.

112
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,560
What should I do?

113
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,900
A frontal attack?

114
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,980
Commendable resolve!

115
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,080
What?

116
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,750
I was careless!

117
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,430
Lady Farnese!

118
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,490
I was the one who put him down?

119
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,650
Well done, Lady Farnese.

120
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,580
You really are our Lady Commander!

121
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,370
Hey, you! Get up!

122
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,930
Wait, is he dead?

123
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,080
He's unconscious. He seems to be asleep.

124
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,430
Oh, Tonio!

125
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,840
He was a good man...

126
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,130
Lady Farnese, please order a retreat.

127
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,560
Lady Farnese, was this the
first blood you've drawn?

128
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,340
As one who wields a sword,
you mustn't fear it.

129
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,680
But always remember
the weight of a life taken,

130
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,570
so long as you have men under your command.

131
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,410
What's this?

132
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,530
Very well!

133
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,910
All troops, retreat!

134
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,840
Hey, are you alive?

135
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,170
Yeah, somehow.

136
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,460
Well, you're a hard one to kill.

137
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,650
Here.

138
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,570
Good work.

139
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,490
On the battlefield, a common soldier's life
is worth less than a single silver coin.

140
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,870
In this day and age, most people are

141
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,480
abused by royalty and the nobility.

142
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,300
Well, not that even kings can
live as they please.

143
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,060
Everyone is merely swept along by the tide.

144
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,510
The tide known as fate.

145
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,840
And their lives spent,

146
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,500
they vanish into its depths.

147
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,130
They die before learning who they truly are.

148
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,390
Some, regardless of rank or station,
are born as key individuals,

149
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,990
who will shape this world.

150
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,780
They are the true privileged class.

151
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,250
I want to know who I am in this world.

152
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,910
What I am capable of,

153
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,810
and what I am meant to do.

154
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,170
How strange.

155
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,220
I've never spoken to anyone about this before.

156
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,040
At that moment,

157
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,770
the man appeared to me as something
beautiful, noble, and absolute.

158
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,710
We have brought the Black Swordsman.

159
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,380
Enter.

160
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:11,900
Yes, my lady.

161
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,410
Well done.

162
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,050
After you bind him to the post,
you are free to go.

163
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,280
But that would—

164
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,260
No need for concern.

165
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,450
With those gigantic shackles,
what harm could he possibly do?

166
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,530
We shall inform the vice-commander, then.

167
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,530
That won't be necessary.

168
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,330
But...

169
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:33,750
Further, instruct the guards to leave
this tent until I order otherwise.

170
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,000
But if something should happen...

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,570
We should inform the vice-commander.

172
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,430
What is your name and rank?

173
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,460
You dare say you cannot follow my order

174
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,860
unless the vice-commander tells you to?!

175
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,150
Tell me, who is the Supreme Commander
of the Holy Iron Chain Knights?

176
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,440
Yes, my lady! It is you, Commander Farnese!

177
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,730
I deeply regret speaking out of turn!

178
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,720
As long as you bear this in mind. Leave.

179
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,190
Yes, my lady!

180
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,450
Black Swordsman...

181
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,410
Or should I say... Guts, was it?

182
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,350
Before we deliver you to the Holy See,

183
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,600
it falls to me, as one of the grand
tribunal's junior members,

184
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,130
to ask you a few simple questions.

185
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,710
Why do you laugh, cur?!

186
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,400
Oh, I was just thinking that
I have the worst luck

187
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,890
with God and things of that ilk.

188
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,100
Blasphemy. I shan't allow you
to blaspheme a second time.

189
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,600
The Band of the Hawk.

190
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,020
A band of mercenaries, hired by Midland.

191
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,820
The Band of the Hawk.

192
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,630
An elite military force that
won countless victories,

193
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,810
their military prowess
was said to be peerless.

194
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,290
But they plotted treason against the royal
family, becoming wanted fugitives.

195
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,640
However, the entire company
vanished into thin air overnight.

196
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,620
No one heard, even in rumors,
that the bounty was claimed.

197
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,630
Did someone obliterate them?

198
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,560
All we know is that there
are very few survivors.

199
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,360
Th-The leader of the Band
of the Hawk was Griffith.

200
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,300
After he went missing,

201
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,410
it's said a woman replaced
him as their leader.

202
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,760
It's also said that the captain of their raiders

203
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,450
wielded a massive sword and could
slay a hundred men with ease.

204
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,240
You seem to match his description.

205
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,040
And if I recall, his name was...

206
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,770
Also...

207
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,140
A questionable item,

208
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,710
one that would conceivably be
in a heretic's possession...

209
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,970
Nice, isn't it?

210
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,120
If this is a heathen idol,

211
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,000
you will be tried as a heretic.

212
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,610
If you do not wish to endure that,
you should confess everything now.

213
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,330
Is that not preferable to

214
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,210
being interrogated under torture,
then burned at the stake?

215
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,660
Answer me, cur!

216
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,490
Do you believe in God and the devil?

217
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,010
What's your point?

218
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,980
Are you trying to blaspheme yet again?

219
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,830
Have you ever met God?

220
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,680
God does not show us His miraculous
existence on this Earth so easily.

221
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,120
Through our faith, God is always with us.

222
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,420
In our souls and up in Heaven.

223
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,430
Wh-Why do you laugh?

224
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,590
What a picture-perfect response.

225
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,570
Did you learn that in a convent?

226
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,940
On a battlefield, a nobleman
said the exact same thing,

227
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,970
burning a city to the ground,
with its women and children.

228
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,090
I'm not talking about some shitty, useless god

229
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,950
who's just an empty decoration.

230
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,560
A confession would be a waste of time.

231
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,520
I have no intention of repenting,

232
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,760
and I don't think you'll learn
anything, even if I told you.

233
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,460
Just go say a prayer for me in
some moldy temple, will you?

234
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,450
You cur!

235
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,590
You just had to say that?

236
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,710
Cur,

237
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,390
how dare you blaspheme in front of me,

238
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,100
Commander of the Holy Iron Chain Knights?

239
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,150
I was prepared to show mercy,

240
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,900
in consideration of your
injuries, but no longer!

241
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,040
I shall make you talk,

242
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,290
even if it means flaying
the skin from your body!

243
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,140
I swear this by my faith!

244
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,240
You're trying way too hard, aren't you?

245
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,030
Be it God or your rank,

246
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,650
whatever weight you're trying to
throw around won't earn loyalty.

247
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,720
Not like that Knight of the Bridge commands.

248
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,040
If you ask me,

249
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,730
you're just like that idol you
worship, all empty inside.

250
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,010
You...

251
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,110
You!

252
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,560
How dare you?!

253
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,960
Lady Farnese!

254
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,790
Excuse me... Just what is going on?

255
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,580
Lady Farnese, what is the meaning of this?

256
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,130
Why all this commotion?

257
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,080
I am simply questioning him,

258
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,790
before we deliver him to the Holy See.

259
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,370
However, this is...

260
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,570
I am finished.

261
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,160
Return him to his cell.

262
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,720
You are dismissed, as well.

263
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,020
Lady Farnese...

264
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,040
Did you not hear me?

265
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,410
I said, you are dismissed!

266
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,440
As you wish.

267
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,870
Do not unshackle him.

268
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,810
Tend his wounds, and leave him in the cell.

269
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,930
Take him!

270
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,820
Yes, sir!

271
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,710
Don't be so rough on our commander, please.

272
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,830
She may not look it, but she
can be quite charming.

273
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,740
I can't afford to be wasting time here.

274
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,560
Shit.

275
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,070
I don't have time to be playing
nice with these lunatics.

276
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,520
Casca...

277
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,470
And...

278
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,360
It's nearly time.

279
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,080
Shit...

280
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,580
Unarmed and imprisoned,

281
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,730
not to mention not in the best shape.

282
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,340
What to do?

283
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,090
Hup!

284
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,040
I guess I had this guy.

285
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,950
I'm here to save you, Guts.

286
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,680
See, you can escape with this key.

287
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,430
Why are you here?

288
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,190
Elves have a strong sense of responsibility.

289
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,190
What're you gonna do?

290
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,530
I'm getting my stuff back.

291
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,150
It's everything I have, after all.

292
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,330
But your weapons are in that woman's tent.

293
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,840
That's perfect.

294
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,760
Depending how it goes, we'll take her hostage.

295
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,980
What?

296
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,230
I don't give a rat's ass if I end up
having to kill the lot of them.

297
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,720
There's someone I need to
find, no matter what.

298
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,420
I don't give a damn what happens
to those who try to stop me.

299
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,550
What's going on?

300
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,590
Oh, God... Please guide me.

301
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,100
You!

302
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,560
Oh, man...

303
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,420
Charming, huh?

304
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,920
You were hurt pretty bad.

305
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,940
You can't swing it around this soon.
You'll reopen the wound.

306
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,810
Guess I'm still at half strength.

307
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,230
Lady Farnese, we have an emergency.

308
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,620
The Black Swordsman has...

309
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,600
You—

310
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,620
That's brutal.

311
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,260
Guess I'll have to ask her along, after all.

312
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,860
A fire!

313
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,490
The Black Swordsman has escaped!

314
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,500
Stop it from spreading to the other tents!

315
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,970
Lady Farnese!

316
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,020
You...

317
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,230
How did you...

318
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,980
Step aside, old man.

319
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,280
You think you can escape with those injuries?

320
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,430
Yeah, I do.

321
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,870
The practice of burning people to death
isn't limited to clerics, is it?

322
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,870
Well?

323
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,610
I'll burn her ass.

324
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,320
Taking a woman hostage... You coward!

325
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,820
You leave us no choice.

326
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,440
Fall back, everyone.

327
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,600
Sorry.

328
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,410
What have you done?

329
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,340
Don't worry.

330
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,840
Hurry!

331
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,480
Gather the horses!

332
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,150
This is my biggest folly yet.

333
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,310
We cannot let him escape!

334
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,420
Who's that?

335
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,280
You're unbelievable.

336
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,120
Who do you think you have to
thank for being able to run this far?

337
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,950
The horse.

338
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,870
Then apologize to the horse.

339
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,200
Sorry, horse.

340
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,940
As long as you remember that.

341
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,000
Hey.

342
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,520
How the tables have turned, eh?

343
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,650
Quit struggling...

344
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,090
With your hands tied, if you fall
on these rocks, you'll die!

345
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,180
Don't worry.

346
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,520
We won't eat you or anything.

347
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,860
Oh, I'm Puck.

348
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,080
Let me go, cur!

349
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,240
How dare you treat the Commander of the Holy Iron Chain Knights this way—

350
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,220
Shut up.

351
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:27,950
Oh, hey!

352
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,560
Keep this up, and I'll just
knock you out again.

353
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,600
Sorry, you'll have to come along for now.

354
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,480
And there's something I want to ask you.

355
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,660
This is humiliating!

356
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,900
How could a heretic do this to me?

357
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,060
Let me down!

358
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,090
I'd rather fall and die than listen to you!

359
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,790
No!

360
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,120
Just calm down a bit, will you?

361
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,970
Jeez, isn't he capable of
love for his fellow man?

362
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:51,810
Nope.

363
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,020
Sorry, miss.

364
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,920
How dare you? Don't mock me!

365
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,350
What are you doing?

366
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,370
She isn't looking.

367
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:03,880
Huh?

368
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,460
She isn't trying to see me.

369
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,540
She can't...

370
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,770
She can't see elves.

371
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,540

00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,540
Does this have to do with what
was foretold in Revelations, as well?

373
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,630
Be nice to dogs.

374
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,590
I just remembered for
the first time in a while...

375
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Humans who oppose us are just food.

376
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
I've had enough of miracles.

377
