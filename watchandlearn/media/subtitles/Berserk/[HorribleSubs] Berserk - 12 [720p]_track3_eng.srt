2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,140
How can he be this way?

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,520
Amidst such despair,

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,860
when others cling to each other, how can he
speak of survival, as though it's a given?

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,650
Why does this man's voice resonate
so strongly within me?

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,160
That thing will either disappear or
weaken when the sun hits it.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,540
We just have to last until morning.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to survive.

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,580
How can this man's voice

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,840
sound so reassuring to me?

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,010
Those Who Cling, Those Who Struggle

12
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,070
I hope it's not broken...

13
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,030
I have to get out of here.

14
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,450
Someone!

15
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,750
It hurts...

16
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,170
Is anyone out there?

17
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,710
Someone's out there?

18
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,800
Please...

19
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,170
I can't walk!

20
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,380
Please help...

21
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,730
That was a close call.

22
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,320
It was like a cattle stampede.

23
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,610
I'm sorry for being late.

24
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,280
Are you okay?

25
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,030
Luca!

26
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,070
I've been watching from below.

27
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,700
It looks like Elaine and the others are okay.

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,700
Luca!

29
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,200
Now, now...

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,080
This isn't the time to get sentimental.

31
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,630
Can you walk?

32
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,180
Yeah, but I can't run.

33
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,590
What should we do?

34
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,970
I-I can't do this!

35
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,640
Don't poke your head out, no matter what.

36
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,230
But what are you going to do, Luca?

37
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,850
I'll figure something out.

38
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,440
I don't want that!

39
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,190
I'm too scared to be alone.

40
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,780
I can't do it!

41
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,740
I need you to stay with me!

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,240
Ow...

43
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,410
Both of us won't fit in this barrel.

44
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,370
Besides, who'd seal it?

45
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,410
But...

46
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,670
Honestly, you're such a scaredy-cat!

47
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,000
Luca...

48
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,800
If nothing else, be a
proper scaredy-cat, okay?

49
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,220
Keep quiet, and don't make a sound.

50
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,600
You just might be the type
that survives the longest.

51
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,810
There.

52
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,150
Luca...

53
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,740
Luca!

54
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,370
Ever since that day,

55
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,870
I've felt like I'm wandering
through an endless night.

56
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,790
But I had forgotten...

57
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,530
That this world is a place
where the sun rises.

58
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,180
The time has finally come to
draw this secret sword.

59
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,590
Even just based on that,

60
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,930
I have a big advantage compared to back then.

61
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,480
Shit!

62
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,270
There are too many to burn...

63
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,190
More and more keep showing up!

64
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,240
Take this...

65
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,370
Explosive Fire Sword!

66
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,160
Oh?

67
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,040
Don't act dumb, you shitty bug!

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll squash you!

69
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,250
Anyway, what's up with these guys?

70
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,380
It's the resentment of those who died
here due to torture or epidemic.

71
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,180
It's absorbing the emotions
of those engulfed,

72
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,760
continuing to expand.

73
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,850
It's full of their hatred
and desire for salvation!

74
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,020
If hate is all something like that takes,

75
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,730
the whole world would've sunk
into a cesspool by now!

76
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,520
Why is it just happening in Albion?

77
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,150
Well...

78
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,620
This is impossible.

79
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,660
It should not be possible.

80
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,290
It's just like before.

81
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,670
It's like I'm in a nightmare.

82
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,710
Is this actually happening in reality?

83
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,520
If you don't want to die, do something.

84
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,900
Lady Farnese...

85
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,320
He still stands and refuses to back down
in this overwhelming nightmare.

86
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,280
In all of this, he is the only certainty!

87
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,490
Shit!

88
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,030
It's coming in from behind, too!

89
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,490
Behind me, Lady Farnese!

90
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,290
O-Oh, God...

91
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,450
Don't pray!

92
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,420
If you pray, your hands are closed.

93
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,460
What's that you're holding?

94
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,340
Here they come!

95
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,020
No!

96
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,980
This is the end...

97
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,110
I'm going to get crushed.

98
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,320
I'm dead! I'm dead!
I'm dead! I'm going to die!

99
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,740
I can't stand it... Let me out.

100
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,900
Let me out of here!

101
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,530
Not now.

102
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,790
I might just die, anyway...

103
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,340
But it's warm.

104
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,380
I don't know if I'll die yet.

105
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,300
The more scared I am, the more alive I feel.

106
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,090
The more blood I cough up,

107
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,010
the more I know that it's warm in my veins!

108
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,140
I'm going to try...

109
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,230
I'm going to try, Luca.

110
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,520
Being scared means that I want to live!

111
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,460
That's...

112
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,110
Incredible.

113
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:40,870
Both the living and dead. All the souls
here are calling out for one thing.

114
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,210
Right now...

115
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,420
Everything in my world
is one unified thought.

116
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,460
Everything desires me,

117
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,300
the world I will create,
and calls out for it.

118
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,680
Everything will be

119
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,890
fulfilled by one voice.

120
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,100
Singing?

121
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,860
Guts, that...

122
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,780
Huh?

123
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,860
This.

124
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,990
It's resonating with the voices.

125
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,290
Hey...

126
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:21,990
Guts!

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,790
What is this agony coming from?

128
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,460
Oh, God...

129
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,520
Ah, the light overflows...

130
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,540
Griffith!

131
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,130
There will be a pillar of fire

132
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,680
where blind sheep gather on holy ground.

133
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,680
The hour of Heaven's fall...

134
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,140
It has come.

135
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,300
This is bad...

136
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,680
The tower and the monsters
vanished overnight.

137
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,200
Were we just having a bad dream?

138
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,290
I'm alive?

139
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,700
Oh, the puffy lady's alive!

140
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,120
I'm alive...

141
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm really alive.

142
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,710
Oh, where's Luca?

143
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,760
Please!

144
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,710
Luca...

145
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,260
Find Luca!

146
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,220
Wait a minute.

147
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,380
What's going on?

148
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,350
Luca jammed me into the barrel.

149
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,770
I don't know what happened after that...

150
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,100
Luca!

151
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,350
Luca!

152
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,520
Lady!

153
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,100
Luca!

154
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,150
Damn it...

155
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,270
How will we find her in all this rubble?!

156
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,320
I don't want this...

157
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,440
No, Luca...

158
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,110
Huh?

159
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,120
O-O-Over here!

160
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,540
She said.

161
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,710
H-H-H-Hurry up... Get me out of here.

162
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,180
I-I-I-I'm going to catch a chill!

163
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,050
Luca!

164
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,560
I'm freezing!

165
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,350
You idiot...

166
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,140
There, there...

167
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,980
You're so warm.

168
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,480
It was worth living for.

169
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,540
They're Kushans!

170
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,580
Why are they all the way out here?

171
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,630
The guys from back then.

172
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,920
That is the krishna sena from earlier.

173
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,340
Could he be the one?

174
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,510
I don't know.

175
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,720
Yet just as the divine prophecy said,

176
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,640
there was a calamity in this
land, and he appeared.

177
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,940
The one we seek must be
among them, as well.

178
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,100
No way...

179
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,070
If we don't get outta here after
all that, I'm calling bullshit!

180
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,990
Capture them all!

181
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,200
They must be alive, not unharmed.

182
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,160
Specifically, don't go easy on the
man with the massive sword.

183
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,790
Don't lower your guard until
you've cut off his limbs.

184
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,880
Killing blow!

185
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,800
Personal issues aside,

186
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,680
I cannot think of a better man to have
at my side in such a circumstance.

187
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,020
Although, it may not amount to much...

188
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,260
Whatever.

189
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,360
Damn!

190
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,520
Don't move!

191
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,110
If you make a single move, these women...

192
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,980
Hey.

193
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,700
Taking women and children
as hostages? Barbarians.

194
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,440
Heretics,

195
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,080
how dare you enter our holy
land and do such a thing?!

196
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,820
Azan!

197
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,540
You're tough to kill...

198
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,330
Lady Farnese, I am glad to see you safe.

199
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,120
Thanks.

200
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,450
You, as well, Vice-commander.

201
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,660
We can talk later.

202
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,880
Hmm...

203
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,380
Things have taken a strange turn
in the short time I was away.

204
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,170
Here they come.

205
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,480
What the hell?

206
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,480
Hey, not again!

207
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,480
B-Bada?

208
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,070
Is this the continuation of last night?

209
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,330
Nothing can surprise me anymore.

210
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,700
Zodd...

211
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,080
Why is he here?

212
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,500
How monstrous...

213
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,540
This isn't the time to be impressed.

214
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,840
If we're to escape, it must be now!

215
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,170
Indeed.

216
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,750
Everyone, stay together!

217
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,300
We'll storm through this!

218
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,620
In that moment,

219
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,580
all held their breath.

220
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,620
And all were transfixed.

221
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,880
Griffith...

222
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,400
And all realized...

223
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,940
That what they had desired had come.

224
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,960
All of you, seize that man!

225
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,410
But, Lord Silat...

226
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,620
Stay calm.

227
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,870
This mission is critical for restoring
our Bakiraka Clan's honor!

228
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,380
Have you forgotten our clan's
centuries of torment in exile?

229
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,960
This is our one and only chance.

230
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,390
Capture him before their main forces arrive!

231
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,890
Go!

232
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,940
Good!

233
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,810
Their ranks here have thinned!

234
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,230
Lady Farnese!

235
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,070
Why are you two bumbling around?

236
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,090
Where are Elaine and the swordsman?

237
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,350
Don't tell me they're still back there.

238
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,380
Wait!

239
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,350
Haven't you had enough?

240
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,350
Shut up! Privates can stay back!

241
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,880
What'd you say, brat?

242
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,110
Even the main Kushan forces are here?

243
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,620
They haven't noticed us yet...

244
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,800
No way!

245
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,440
You're leaving those two behind?

246
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,170
What choice do we have?

247
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,870
If we don't, we'll die for sure this time!

248
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,700
Shit!

249
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,580
What the...

250
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,150
Who is he?

251
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,180
He isn't human.

252
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,780
Do we ever get a break?

253
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,530
What now?

254
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,830
He made it!

255
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,840
But against such a large army...

256
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,710
He'll be fine.

257
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,840
I'm sure he'll protect Elaine.

258
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,590
He'd better not die!

259
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,470
I'm gonna collect what he owes me!

260
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,600
Idiot! Keep it down!

261
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,180
Huh...

262
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,360
There were other survivors.

263
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,560
Everyone who fled into the tower died.

264
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,070
And those of little faith who fled
from the tower survived?

265
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,370
I bet none of them will ever
feel like praying again...

266
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,410
Not so fast.

267
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:13,500
Trying to survive is different
than trying to run from fear.

268
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,640
The survivors did what
they had to do to live,

269
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,750
without their surroundings interfering.

270
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,550
I don't know what God thinks or anything,

271
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:29,050
but I believe He left humans enough
free will to do what they need to.

272
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,560
Luca, what's that for?

273
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,900
Oh, this?

274
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,340
It's for a chick that died in the egg.

275
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,270
It died without ever leaving the egg.

276
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,340
Without meeting anyone or being known.

277
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,120
A lonely one like that
sleeps beneath the rubble.

278
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,490
I thought I should leave flowers for it.

279
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,800
Any sinner should have at least
one person to mourn them.

280
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,920
But if his wish came true,

281
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,140
what will happen to the world now?

282
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,430
Later, ladies!

283
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,140
I'm gonna bail! Bye!

284
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,230
As thanks, I'll be with you for free.

285
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,150
Whoa!

286
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,600
I'm in a hurry, though...

287
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,400
I'll take you up on it another time!

288
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,690
They were a busy bunch...

289
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,820
Thankfully, they're gone.

290
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,860
I wonder if Elaine's okay.

291
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,570
I'm sure she'll be fine with
that black swordsman.

292
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,580
He even fought Mozgus as an equal.

293
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,290
But...

294
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,750
The strength to protect someone

295
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,750
is different than the strength
to be with someone...

296
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,550
I need to take care of something.

297
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,840
Are you okay?

298
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
Yeah.

299
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,850
Nina?

300
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,270
Joachim...

301
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,850
You're alive.

302
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,240
I've been wanting to apologize to you...

303
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,780
For before.

304
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,360
I was so scared of you.

305
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,610
I thought they'd kill me
if I didn't rat you out...

306
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,780
I know it's too late for me to say this,

307
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,290
but I really care for you...

308
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,000
I really thought I could go with you.

309
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,280
But I didn't have the courage,

310
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,000
so I ran away.

311
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,140
I'm sorry.

312
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,260
Goodbye.

313
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,380
W-Wait.

314
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,110
Wh-What did you say?

315
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,810
I'm going to follow the Black Swordsman.

316
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,140
I am leaving the Order.

317
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,040
Later.

318
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,460
In the end, I could not escape
the darkness of my childhood.

319
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,260
Eventually, the darkness took shape
and appeared before me.

320
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,260
As though the fate for one
who continues to fear

321
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,810
is to be led by the Black Swordsman

322
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,360
who stands alone in the darkness.

323
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,980
They left.

324
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,740
Thank goodness...

325
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,410
Hmm, Nina's late.

326
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,950
Hey, introduce me to a noble patron, too!

327
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,280
Me, too.

328
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,450
Someone with more money
than you, if possible.

329
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,430
Are you sure?

330
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,760
Yeah, if I go back now,
I won't be able to leave.

331
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,440
I'm sorry, Luca.

332
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,470
I'm making you worry until the very end.

333
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,840
I'm going with Joachim.

334
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,230
I love you and the others.

335
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,140
But if I stay with you,

336
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,190
I'll end up hating you again someday.

337
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,780
And I'll hate myself, too.

338
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,200
People who are strong will
end up hurting others,

339
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,160
and people who are weak
will end up hating others.

340
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:20,330
I think I'll go with this man, who has
the same weakness and sin.

341
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,670
If I'm with him, I think we can both
become a little stronger.

342
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,090
And a little kinder.

343
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,260
So slow!

344
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,270
She really is such a handful.

345
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,810
A rift appeared in the frontier that day.

346
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,640
Where the world's shape began to crumble.

347
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,580
2017 Spring

348
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,800
The Next Arc Arrives
