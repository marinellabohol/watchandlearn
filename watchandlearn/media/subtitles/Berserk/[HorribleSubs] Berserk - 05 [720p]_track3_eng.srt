00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,980
Hey, brat...

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,730
Put that down.

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,730
No way!

5
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,660
After four whole days, I finally got this food.

6
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,840
You should all work for what you need.

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,670
Don't latch on to a kid!

8
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,040
You're all grown-ups!

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,940
Man, talk about pathetic...

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:16,740
Ow!

11
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,090
Says a burglar.

12
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,350
Want me to make it so you never
become a pathetic grown-up?

13
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,120
Right here, right now, squirt.

14
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,840
You giant freak!

15
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,420
You look like your brain
stunted at three years old.

16
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,010
I'm not gonna say that out loud, though.

17
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,530
You just did, idiot.

18
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,200
Don't get so hung up over the details.

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,000
Here.

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,390
I don't want to die before
I've had a girl, anyway.

21
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,630
Nice.

22
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,410
There's even ale.

23
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,530
The villagers here must've run off in a hurry!

24
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,550
I bet there are valuables, too.

25
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,900
Many thanks to the Kushans!

26
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,380
Is it good?

27
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,030
Yeah, but there's not enough for you.

28
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,060
Oh, yeah?

29
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,530
I scrounged all that food together.

30
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,080
I hope you take the time to enjoy it.

31
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,330
Yeah, yeah. Just go already—

32
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,840
Hey, what's wrong?

33
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,060
Brat, what did you do?!

34
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,940
Oh, this sure is potent.

35
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,340
It was pretty expensive, after all...

36
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,280
My share's over here.

37
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,260
I'm not a fan of being underestimated.

38
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,660
Squirt...

39
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,010
I'm gonna crack your head right open—

40
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,620
Don't call me "squirt."

41
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,060
I have a name, Isidoro.

42
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,940
Don't worry, it's just bee venom.

43
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,380
It won't kill you.

44
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,520
Have a change of heart and live honestly.

45
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,640
You know, it's sad when a kid's lecturing you!

46
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,420
Later.

47
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,430
Hey, what's wrong?

48
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,660
Everyone's passed out.

49
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,640
Shit!

50
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,200
I didn't know there were more.

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,700
Calm down... Stay calm...

52
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,360
Think... Think!

53
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,920
What happened?!

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,250
Who's this brat?

55
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,310
I was so scared!

56
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,850
It was the Kushans!

57
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,680
What?

58
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,320
The army came and...

59
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,260
N-No, he—

60
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,190
What now?

61
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,810
We have to get out of here.

62
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,900
We don't have time to lose!

63
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,570
Fools...

64
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,850
Hang on, brat.

65
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,570
It doesn't make sense.

66
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,470
I didn't hear any hooves or anything.

67
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,650
And look... None of them have
injuries caused by swords.

68
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,150
Now that you mention it...

69
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,900
What's with you, brat?

70
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,420
Why are you unharmed,
if Kushans were here?

71
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,350
Huh? Because I'm just a kid...

72
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,540
The Kushans have no mercy, even for kids.

73
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,610
Where'd they go?

74
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,360
Um...

75
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,480
Shit! Shit!

76
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,610
Th-That way!

77
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,160
Hmm?

78
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,170
Tower of Conviction

79
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,170
It's the Kushans!

80
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,750
They're Kushan scouts!

81
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,670
We're surrounded!

82
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,410
Shit, we have to fight!

83
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,800
No way...

84
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,190
They all died in a flash!

85
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,220
That's...

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,600
What was that for?

87
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,320
What an unexpected test of my new blade.

88
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:22,210
He cut up those Kushan monsters
with one strike!

89
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,980
Hey, clear the way. I'm in a hurry.

90
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,390
What's with you guys?

91
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,970
No talking my way out of this?

92
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,470
Hey, squirt...

93
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,810
Hey, stay still, with your head down.

94
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,620
You're...

95
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,810
Hey, been a while!

96
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,630
Nice work, as usual, Godo.

97
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,430
Hey, you have food, huh?

98
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,870
And ale, too.

99
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,900
I can smell them, even though they're hidden.

100
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,470
They'll do as a sign of thanks.

101
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,790
No need to hold back.

102
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,250
A-Amazing!

103
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,350
Hey, let's go, Puck.

104
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,180
Okay.

105
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,640
Whoa!

106
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,810
W-Wait...

107
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,980
He's no ordinary guy!

108
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,060
You are certain we can let that
man go, Young Master?

109
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,910
It's of no consequence.

110
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,530
The Bakiraka Clan's duty is to scout ahead.

111
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,840
There is no need to take further casualties.

112
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,450
But if we, the Tapasa, combine our strength—

113
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,430
Do not underestimate him.

114
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
We may be able to subdue him, yes.

115
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,670
But we will not do so unscathed.

116
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,980
You know of this man, Young Master?

117
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,560
It was in the past...

118
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,880
A very long time ago.

119
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,000
Quickly.

120
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,300
Hurry.

121
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,400
Not another monk...

122
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,610
It was heretics.

123
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,780
There will be even more inquisitions now...

124
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,070
Hey, stop!

125
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,530
Alms...

126
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,600
Alms, I beg of you.

127
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,470
Fools!

128
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,300
These are tributes to the monastery.

129
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,360
You have already received your daily rations.

130
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,930
That soup of vegetable scraps isn't enough!

131
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,360
You guys eat your fill every day, right?

132
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,910
Please have mercy...

133
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,030
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

134
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,450
Ah, food!

135
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,100
Alms!

136
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,500
Mercy!

137
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,700
S-Stop!

138
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,470
Catch them all!

139
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,540
Don't let a single one escape!

140
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,100
Crap...

141
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,880
It's the Holy Iron Chain Knights!

142
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,240
P-Please help—

143
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,170
Have mercy!

144
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,300
What is the meaning of this?

145
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,710
Is this what the faithful would do?

146
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,290
Some of us are sick...

147
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,070
We've been living on watery soup for days.

148
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,140
We have no firewood for winter!

149
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,170
We have already requested food, medicine,
and other supplies from the Holy See.

150
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,440
You are not the only ones who suffer!

151
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,420
Please...

152
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,330
My child no longer even
has the strength to nurse.

153
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,040
He's about to die.

154
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,180
He needs God's protection right away!

155
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,700
What?

156
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,700
Very well.

157
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:47,710
Because of your bravery, God will
show you His mercy.

158
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,460
But, Father Mozgus, that will disrupt order!

159
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,490
Of course I have considered that.

160
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,790
But I believe the fact that I am here

161
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,400
and that she has sinned
and has been brought before me

162
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,220
are all part of God's design.

163
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,560
It is said that love knows no fear.

164
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,610
We should respond to her act of
pure love, committed without

165
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,570
regard for her own well-being.

166
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,070
Thank you! Thank you!

167
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,070
For now, let us take these
people to the monastery.

168
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,080
These men should go there.

169
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,610
Do not worry.

170
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,230
You will see them again later.

171
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,510
Now, you will go this way.

172
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,750
Now, drink...

173
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,690
Good.

174
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,970
The child seems to be stable now.

175
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,680
If he stays nourished and gets some rest,

176
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,250
he'll recover soon.

177
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,560
I'm so glad!

178
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,880
I have sent a message to the Holy
See with a request for aid.

179
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,460
I shall also see if we can distribute
a portion of the food

180
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,200
from the earlier tributes among the refugees.

181
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,870
Oh, I don't know what to say...

182
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,330
Thank you!

183
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,340
I have merely executed God's will.

184
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,800
Now, come this way, please.

185
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,100
As one of the faithful, you have
a duty to perform.

186
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,180
Lady Farnese, I believe this is the first
time you've set foot in this room.

187
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,940
You must not look away!

188
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,860
This hellish scene is part of
the Holy See you serve.

189
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,020
It is not only benevolence that God
bestows upon this world.

190
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,460
He is also a stern judge.

191
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,200
You must not flee!

192
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,870
To save your child, you have sinned.

193
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,090
Your love and bravery should be praised.

194
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,800
However, sin is sin!

195
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,360
Because you are so brave,

196
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,730
I beg you to overcome this
ordeal from God Himself!

197
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
Surrender yourself to God's grace.

198
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
N-No!

199
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,550
Let me go...

200
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,620
I didn't kill any monk!

201
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,670
I'm not a heretic!

202
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,880
We have a witness to the crime!

203
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,520
What the hell? Shit!

204
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,510
Who was it?

205
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,750
Who framed me?

206
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,080
I'll kill you!

207
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,550
I'll kill you when I come back!

208
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,000
Take him.

209
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,020
Ah...

210
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,310
He's the thug who's been intimidating
everyone around here.

211
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,410
No one liked him...

212
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,330
I guess someone decided to get rid of him,

213
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,060
but I feel like spitting on both their faces.

214
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,250
Can you try to get more into this?

215
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,380
Oh, oops, sorry!

216
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,530
But are you sure about this?

217
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,320
Every day, you're here before
the sun's even set.

218
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,070
You don't want me here?

219
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,820
No, you're special...

220
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,150
Business aside, I'm glad to have you here.

221
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,080
But I'm worried that you'll get reprimanded

222
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,760
by that scary commander lady.

223
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,170
No need to worry about her.

224
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,490
All she talks about is duty and faith.

225
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,450
She works her men hard,

226
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,540
but she isn't skilled in fighting or leadership.

227
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,500
For the Holy Iron Chain Knights, having a
female commander is tradition.

228
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,140
She's only a figurehead.

229
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,220
It must be tough, I'm sure...

230
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,620
To be the only woman among men.

231
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,940
I don't even want to know what it takes to
work so hard on a shitty mission like that.

232
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,800
You hedonist...

233
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,160
Oh.

234
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,220
Bad Elaine!

235
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,670
I've told you that you can't come
in here. This is my job!

236
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,980
I've gone all soft...

237
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,260
Sorry, she's my little sister.

238
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,460
What's with all the bandages?

239
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,130
Disease that comes with our profession.

240
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,300
She was unlucky.

241
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,680
She's almost all gone upstairs.

242
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,630
That's too bad.

243
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,590
Well, for now, I'll go home.

244
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,540
I'll give you extra next time.

245
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,360
Here, the usual fee.

246
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,170
And here.

247
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,950
Wow, that's pretty...

248
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,310
It wasn't cheap.

249
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,950
It'd be out of reach for common folk.

250
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,020
I'm happy you got it for me, but I'm not
sure I deserve something like this.

251
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,840
Cast not pearls before... You know.

252
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,010
I think I'm getting too old for this.

253
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,710
Once this job's done,

254
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,060
I'll take you back home.

255
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,410
As the family heir, I can't marry you,

256
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,850
but all the nobles have mistresses, anyway.

257
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,460
I'll pamper you.

258
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,070
We'll bring your little sister, too.

259
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,390
I'll find her a good doctor.

260
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,690
Thanks, Jerome...

261
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,400
I'll wait, but I won't expect anything.

262
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,410
Jeez, I couldn't be a whore if I took
all the pillow talk seriously...

263
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,420
Hey, hey!

264
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,910
I heard that, Luca.

265
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,160
Girls...

266
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,050
Lucky Luca...

267
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,610
I wish someone would talk like that to me!

268
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,310
Oh, stop it.

269
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,700
It's only because it's good to know influential
people for when you need help.

270
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,170
Aw...

271
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,170
Come on!

272
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:24,970
Yeah.

273
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,170
So, by the way, Luca...

274
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,630
Don't eat it all at once.

275
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,620
We know!

276
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,070
Thanks, as always.

277
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,060
Oh, and this...

278
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,100
Wow!

279
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,180
You shouldn't have!

280
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,280
Listen, everyone gets an equal number of pearls.

281
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,940
But this was for you.

282
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,130
I'll keep some, too, of course.

283
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,530
We all agreed to this, remember?

284
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,450
No matter who earns how much,
we split our earnings.

285
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,800
Yeah, but...

286
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,460
This looks so expensive.

287
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,800
Hey, Pepe, Fouquet, Lucie.

288
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,940
Listen well.

289
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,100
We're working in the middle of
a witch hunt for heretics.

290
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,540
You get that, right?

291
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,890
Even though it's to survive, it's so dangerous.

292
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,360
Humans are wretched creatures...

293
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,820
They envy those who have more,

294
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,930
and they sneer at those who have less.

295
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,720
Even the smallest differences
can cause fear and hatred.

296
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,790
I'm sad to say it,

297
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,290
but that's especially true of us, who have little.

298
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,100
That's not true. We're...

299
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,460
That's why we'll prove that we're different.

300
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,990
When actions don't follow
words, there's no trust.

301
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,580
All right, then!

302
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,320
Just like usual, share half our earnings
among our neighbors.

303
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,620
Not again!

304
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,750
That's such a waste...

305
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,920
I told you.

306
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,310
It's so that we don't earn any grudges.

307
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,270
Just go and charm them!

308
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,410
Okay.

309
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,000
Huh? One's missing.

310
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,550
Oh, that's no good.

311
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,780
I'll have to tie it more tightly...

312
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,430
Bear with me, even if it's a bit tight.

313
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,470
If a looker like you went wandering
defenselessly around here,

314
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,740
you wouldn't stay safe for a single day.

315
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,470
You'd be the perfect victim
for all the desperate men.

316
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,950
Normally, I'd ask you to earn your own keep,

317
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,970
but since you aren't even capable
of making your own decisions...

318
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,210
And that brand on her chest...

319
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,860
There must be a story behind it.

320
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,280
Luca!

321
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,210
Oh, hello!

322
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,960
Please wait, good sir.

323
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,800
Nina, I'm going to work another job.

324
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,230
Please make sure everyone gets
food, and take care of Elaine.

325
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,870
Okay.

326
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,450
Also...

327
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,110
Here.

328
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,290
I talked to a customer, a doctor, about you.

329
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,590
And he gave me this.

330
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,230
He said to take two swallows
each morning and night.

331
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,820
Thanks, Luca...

332
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,730
I'll go get some water.

333
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,990
Heretics!

334
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,780
Throw!

335
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,120
Just throw now!

336
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,580
The bleeding just won't stop.

337
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,630
There's some pus in there, too.

338
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,410
My mouth's getting swollen.

339
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,790
This might be it for me...

340
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,750
The doctor said that

341
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,250
if the bad blood reaches
my brain, I'll go insane.

342
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,930
Will I become like you?

343
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,750
Do you have anything you're afraid of, Elaine?

344
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,190
That place is supposed to
be where God is present.

345
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,800
Why does it look so stark and terrifying?

346
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,480
Scared... I'm so scared.

347
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,950
I can't stand it, Luca...

348
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,050
I'm scared of dying and living,

349
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,210
of this world and of God.

350
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,270
I'm... I'm scared of everything!

351
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,940
Found you...

352
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,820
He ran a whole day and a half,
from yesterday afternoon?

353
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,820
If I hadn't hitched a ride on a refugee's
carriage, I would've lost him!

354
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,460
That sharp edge... So giant.

355
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,570
It must be a famous sword!

356
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,880
It won't budge!

357
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,480
But he was wielding it like a feather...

358
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,050
You aren't putting your back into it.

359
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,880
Put your back into it.

360
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,820
Here, like this! See?

361
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,800
I'm Puck.

362
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,520
When you ask people for their names,

363
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,130
you should always introduce yourself first.

364
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,800
I-Isidoro...

365
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,860
Though I didn't ask...

366
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,850
Well, then, Isidoro or whatever,

367
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,880
put your mind to it and give it a go.

368
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,210
You're not trying to stop me?

369
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,440
Heave-ho!

370
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,650
Hey, Guts...

371
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,080
I caught a thief.

372
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,100
It isn't a toy for kids.

373
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,780
It seems you've been following
me since yesterday.

374
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,430
What do you want?

375
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,290
You want to become his apprentice?

376
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,370
Then, you'll have to go through
me, his manager, first—

377
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,030
That's not it!

378
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,490
I don't wanna serve anyone.

379
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,560
O-Oh!

380
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,450
You must've come to take back
the food you gave me!

381
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,390
What a disgrace!

382
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,060
Too bad.

383
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,500
We already ate everything!

384
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,040
That's fine...

385
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,850
You have a sword.

386
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,680
You want to become a swordsman?

387
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,340
Have you ever drawn blood with a sword?

388
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,120
D-Don't underestimate me.

389
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,600
I've killed one or two...

390
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,850
Well, whatever...

391
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,430
You should stay away from me.

392
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,470
What I choose to do is my own business!

393
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,480
You have no right to tell me anything!

394
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,030
Well, you're right.

395
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,990
Hey, thief...

396
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,160
You should run.

397
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,740
My name is Isidoro!

398
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,410
Here they come.

399
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,920
What the hell?

400
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,660
Guts!

401
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,710
Well, this is different.

402
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,680
Shit!

403
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,870
Shit!

404
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,260
Damn you!

405
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,520
Is this real?!

406
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,610
Damn you...

407
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,020
I'll rip you to pieces.

408
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,270
I don't recall anything that'd
make a wheel curse me!

409
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,640
Shit!

410
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,980
Go to hell!

411
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,210
Damn you all!

412
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,400
Full of hatred, eh?

413
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,340
On any other day, I'd feel
the same. But right now...

414
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,010
I don't have the time to deal with you.

415
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,960
I'm in a hurry.

416
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,730
I feel like I'm burning up inside...

417
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,550
Out of the way!

418
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,460

419
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
Shadows, karma... Like I give a damn.

420
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,550
Joy?

421
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,510
You sure have some impressive faith.

422
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,510
You look to be in good health, Struggler.

423
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
All of this, for God alone!

424
