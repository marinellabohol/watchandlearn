2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,880
Orders to return?

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,260
Why, on such short notice, Abbot?

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,880
It is a direct order from the Holy See.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,350
It can be said that the heretics
have been sufficiently quelled.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,990
I thank you for your long service.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,320
Remnants may yet be hiding.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,670
The people are still unsettled.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,900
The investigations and sentencing
will take time to conclude.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,980
In the meantime, what will you
do to maintain security?

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,740
You needn't worry yourself about that.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,470
This directive was not addressed
to the Holy Iron Chain Knights.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,260
But to you alone, Lady Farnese.

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,600
What?

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,910
I am to abandon my own troops?

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,020
I, the commander, should abandon our mission?

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,140
I do not understand.

18
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,270
I cannot accept!

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,430
As for your current mission,

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,910
having Vice-Commander Azan lead in
your stead should not be a problem.

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,950
Lady Farnese, it appears that
this directive comes, in part,

22
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,570
at the wish of Lord Vandimion, your father.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,270
I ask you to understand.

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,080
Though this may be a holy mission,

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,160
your father does not wish you,

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,050
as a woman, to remain long
in such a gruesome place.

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,060
I...

28
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:28,310
House Vandimion funds the majority
of relief supplies for these refugees.

29
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,820
Lady Farnese!

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,320
Please wait, Lady Farnese...

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,450
Ow.

32
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,450
You told my father, didn't you?

33
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,570
Eh?

34
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,090
I know it all!

35
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,250
You report to my family on my actions.

36
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,880
You probably wrote that I am
joyously hunting heretics

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,010
and burning them at the stake, right?

38
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,460
That's...

39
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,320
Was it at my father's order?

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,850
You couldn't deny the master of the house.

41
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,000
Well...

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,600
But do not forget.

43
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,540
I am your master!

44
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,080
You swore your sword to me.

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,140
I am your only master.

46
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,740
Yes, my lady.

47
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,360
Do you hate me?

48
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,000
Why would I?

49
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,000
I have never met anyone as pathetic as you.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,360
You blabbed everything before I
could take a single fingernail.

51
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,010
Sorry...

52
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:51,360
Having sold out your friend,
enjoy your last night alive.

53
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,490
Sorry... Sorry...

54
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,900
Please forgive me...

55
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,790
Blood Flow of the Dead

56
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,510
Well done, Lady Farnese.

57
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,070
It would not be an exaggeration to say

58
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,690
that we have captured nearly
all of the heretics at Albion.

59
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,560
Your reputation as the Holy Iron Chain
Knights' commander is well deserved.

60
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,560
No, it is thanks to God's grace.

61
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,110
By the way, your report indicates

62
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:04,150
that your men encountered several anomalies
while raiding the heretics' lair.

63
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,470
The cave was full of arcane drugs
and incense that the heretics use

64
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,720
during their rituals.

65
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,550
I believe they may have triggered
a mass hallucination.

66
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,040
According to the report,
there is one other thing.

67
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,040
The Black Swordsman, previously sought
by your knights, appeared?

68
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,010
Yes.

69
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,090
Hmm, but why?

70
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,870
H-Hey, stop.

71
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,850
This girl...

72
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,780
What about her?

73
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,810
Oh, it's nothing.

74
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,200
It's just, when the Black
Swordsman appeared,

75
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,500
he seemed to be trying to rescue her.

76
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,470
Witch...

77
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,570
Please save us.

78
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,110
Reporting, sir.

79
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,870
The heretics' confessions indicate

80
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,870
that the girl is their priestess.

81
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,240
Or, perhaps, the very object of their faith.

82
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,000
The priestess of heretics, with ties
to the Black Swordsman...

83
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,530
Hmm...

84
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,230
This is a witch's brand indeed.

85
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,820
Evidently, we must take special
care in investigating this girl.

86
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,710
Casca!

87
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,980
Casca...

88
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,480
Let's go.

89
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,200
You two, stay hidden.

90
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,570
I know you want to hurry, but if
you cause a commotion,

91
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,350
you'll lose your chance to rescue her.

92
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,610
Huh? I haven't seen you around here.

93
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,200
I got a personal summons.

94
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,920
Sorry, but would you take a message?

95
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,010
I'm here for Jerome, of the
Holy Iron Chain Knights—

96
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,870
Huh? Did someone just pass?

97
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,910
I'm sure you imagined it...

98
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,700
Casca!

99
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,360
Wh-What is going on here?

100
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,480
That's...

101
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,580
Stay back, please!

102
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,160
Blood?

103
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,380
I hurt!

104
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,380
I'm starving...

105
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,380
I'm cold!

106
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,910
M-Monsters!

107
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,640
They eat humans.

108
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,060
Don't leave us behind!

109
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,650
Please hurry, Lady Farnese!

110
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,650
W-Wait!

111
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,650
Father Mozgus!

112
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,650
Father Mozgus, we must retreat!

113
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,110
Impertinent witch!

114
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,470
The front entrance is blocked.

115
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,410
Let's escape to the chapel.

116
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,240
Casca!

117
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,280
N-No way...

118
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,740
What is going on here?!

119
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,360
For now, let us ascend!

120
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,260
I shall explain later!

121
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,690
Y-You—

122
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,690
Where is my companion?

123
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,200
Then you did come here for the girl.

124
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,720
Answer me!

125
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,910
Th-That girl is in the cellar...

126
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,070
In the torture chamber...

127
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,210
The torture chamber.

128
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,040
Where is that?

129
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,210
I-It's no use. Even if you go there now...

130
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,250
In the cellar, there are...

131
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,720
There are so many.

132
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,930
Hey! Get your act together!

133
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,660
I don't know!

134
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,190
They shouldn't exist.

135
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,340
They can't exist. Not those things...

136
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,120
Take me to that torture chamber of yours.

137
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,210
No!

138
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,730
Who would go there again?

139
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,860
Sorry, but hurry it up...

140
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,030
I'm about to snap.

141
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,810
I'm so useless...

142
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,650
I'm a worthless human being.

143
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,790
Only one more night.

144
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,770
Even now, I'm only worried about myself.

145
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,890
Because of me, by now, Elaine must be...

146
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,920
But...

147
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,020
I don't want to die—

148
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,730
Retreat! Retreat!

149
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,580
Up! Run up!

150
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,930
What about the prisoners?

151
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,750
Who cares? Abandon them!

152
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,030
What's going on?

153
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,780
U-Um, did...

154
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,420
Did something happen?

155
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,980
Monsters!

156
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,280
Monsters...

157
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,340
Hello?

158
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,560
It's coming from below?

159
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,180
Guards! Please open the door!

160
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,030
No!

161
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,010
Please, someone!

162
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,020
Found you...

163
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,690
Hey.

164
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,460
Luca!

165
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,440
Sorry to keep you waiting.

166
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,320
The emotional reunion will have to wait.

167
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,570
Something is wrong.

168
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,570
Hey, now! What are you doing?

169
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,600
Run!

170
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,610
That way!

171
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,800
It's the plan. It's a diversion.

172
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,830
We'll use them as bait, and escape
while they distract the guards.

173
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,080
Hey, I may not look it, but I
am a heretic hunter.

174
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,150
You're saying that, even now?

175
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,840
You're an accomplice.

176
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,910
Damned brat...

177
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,420
Sorry, Jerome.

178
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,110
I didn't mean to involve you.

179
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,590
Honestly, I've reached
the end of my rope.

180
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,310
But I guess it's all good.

181
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,880
I didn't like the mission, anyway.

182
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,930
And this gives me a break.

183
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,600
Ruining my future over a woman

184
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,730
may be fitting for a prodigal son like me.

185
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,380
Jerome...

186
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,240
All right. With that decided,
let's get out of Albion.

187
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,990
Sorry, we have one more.

188
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,480
Nina, where's Elaine?

189
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,750
I...

190
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,890
d-don't know.

191
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,810
She's probably in the basement.

192
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,510
Everyone's gone. This is your chance.

193
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,880
What's that?

194
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,850
What's going on here?

195
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,990
Impossible.

196
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,790
Only a while ago...

197
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,130
That...

198
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,480
That thing did it!

199
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,060
Hey.

200
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,940
What are you doing?

201
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,560
Trying to get heavy armor
and run down the enemy.

202
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,590
I sneaked in here to save Casca.

203
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,070
But those things came out of
the woodwork in the room.

204
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,290
Where is...

205
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,520
Where is Casca?

206
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,320
Casca was swallowed up by them...

207
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,240
Oh, but something didn't make sense.

208
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,760
Everyone else melted right away,

209
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,450
but Casca didn't.

210
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,090
Even though she was swallowed,
I could still sense her presence.

211
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,610
What is he doing?

212
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,260
I think she's okay.

213
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,960
No, I'm sure of it!

214
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,710
Wh-What is that?

215
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,340
This way.

216
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,170
That's right...

217
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,890
Back then...

218
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,270
Hey, you're free to go.

219
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,040
W-Wait!

220
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,110
I'll come, too!

221
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,250
Please stay back!

222
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,000
The doors will give way soon!

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,510
There is nothing to fear!

224
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,270
This is our faith's moment of truth.

225
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,000
We do not pray to God for salvation.

226
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,410
Faith requires everything from us.

227
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,780
Repent, evil spirits!

228
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:52,530
I have found that faith means death!

229
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Come at me!

230
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,390
Master, draw back!

231
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,140
No matter what may challenge me...

232
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,500
Hey, mister!

233
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,310
I need to go downstairs!

234
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,350
Escaping is the priority!

235
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,360
Elaine, I hope you're safe...

236
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,580
Got it!

237
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,450
If I remember right, the chapel's ahead.

238
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,180
Those doors are pretty thick.

239
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,710
Ideal for holing up in—

240
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,500
Sh-Shit!

241
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,680
Luca!

242
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Close your eyes!

243
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,490
Stones...

244
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,710
Stones!

245
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,730
I have witnessed a miracle!

246
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,820
This is God's will.

247
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,190
I am to guide the people with this power.

248
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,320
Elaine...

249
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,740
That's Elaine!

250
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,130
Hey, square-face!

251
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,740
Hand over that lady!

252
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,520
That will not do.

253
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,540
This witch is the origin of the
evil that festers in Albion.

254
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,570
I am destined to demonstrate

255
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,010
God's victory to the people, by burning
this witch at the stake.

256
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,750
What witch are you talking about?

257
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,370
You guys look tons more suspicious!

258
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,010
Guess we have no choice...

259
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,290
I see.

260
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,910
You seek to interfere with my sacred duty?

261
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:48,610
My disciples have no mercy
toward enemies of God.

262
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,660
Hey, those are above my pay grade!

263
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,920
Luca!

264
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,250
M-Mister, another attack!

265
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,510
The next one's coming!

266
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,930
It's fine! Pull them up, fast!

267
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,870
Here, this way.

268
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,440
The presence is getting stronger.

269
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,200
W-Wait...

270
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,710
Luca...

271
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,450
Nina...

272
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,730
So heavy.

273
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,860
This is how heavy Luca is.

274
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,340
I'm holding Luca's life in my hands.

275
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,720
Right now, all that she is rests in my hands.

276
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,800
If I were to let go...

277
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,220
Jerome, take care of Nina.

278
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,980
Huh?

279
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,810
Hurry! Run!

280
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,350
Luca!

281
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,600
Luca...

282
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,850
Why?

283
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,950
Huh?

284
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,990
What's that?

285
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,000
Is it Death?

286
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,980
Wh-What was that?

287
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,610
I-It flew?

288
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,980
Luca...

289
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,530
I'd forgotten about them!

290
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,140
Get down!

291
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:09,780
Um, you're Death... Right?

292
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,170
Girl, why did you choose to die?

293
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,620
H-Hey, don't go there...

294
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,670
I'm not that noble.

295
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,350
Look, that tower is really tall.

296
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,550
But it has a couple layers, see?

297
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,680
I wouldn't have slammed into the ground.

298
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,780
I thought I could maybe get
away with a broken leg,

299
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,690
as long as the roofs were wooden...

300
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,230
Well, now that I think about it,
it was pretty reckless.

301
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,380
I thought it was the only choice,
so everyone could live, but...

302
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,200
But I guess it didn't work, after all.

303
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,940
I got lucky and was spared pain,

304
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,140
but this doesn't really feel like Heaven.

305
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,600
It is not.

306
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,320
This is a resting place for the dead,
at the foot of that tower.

307
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,210
Huh?

308
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,450
Oh, you mean I'm still alive?

309
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,090
So it seems.

310
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,790
If you wish to stay so, do not move.

311
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,780
Show yourself!

312
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,100
What?

313
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,190
So you are the famed Black Swordsman...

314
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,220
I do not know what you seek to accomplish,

315
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,980
but I cannot let you have this witch,

316
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,410
in the name of God's justice!

317
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,980
Fool, you seek to rebel against God!

318
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,050
I will have you atone with blood.

319
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,460
An Apostle?

320
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,790
No, it's different.

321
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,480
My brand senses something else.

322
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,770
They'll be formidable foes.

323
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,230
And seven of them, at that.

324
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,750
Guts, behind you!

325
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,700
W-Wow!

326
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,460
It was only possible with my assist.

327
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,450
Brat, you've got something
strange on your head...

328
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,490
When did they...

329
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,720
I can't avoid it.

330
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,970
What?

331
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,540
Just one more step.

332

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
What's happening?

334
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,590
Screams?

335
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,550
It begins...

336
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,560
Elven Lethal Head-Strike!

337
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
We desire only one thing.
