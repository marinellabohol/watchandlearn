2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,820
Give it back...

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,330
Give back...

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,530
My warm body...

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,500
Oh, no...

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,300
Let's go home, Elaine!

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,510
It's getting dark.

8
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,510
A Nighttime Feast: Burning at the Stake

9
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,090
Wow...

10
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,290
I knew it, he's...

11
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,060
Shit!

12
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,430
He took off without me again!

13
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,540
He won't leave me behind!

14
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,010
Hey, we've been on the move since yesterday.

15
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,030
If you don't rest, you'll be exhausted
when we reach our destination.

16
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,590
I wonder what happened to the boy.

17
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,770
His nasty looks and stubbornness kind
of reminded me of you, Guts.

18
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,900
Yeah, right.

19
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,390
No sudden stops!

20
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,860
Be more considerate of your host!

21
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,030
What is it this time?

22
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,140
Someone I've known for a long time.

23
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,750
You look to be in good health, Struggler.

24
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,620
An elf?

25
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,690
An interesting choice of companions.

26
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,840
Huh?

27
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,260
He's kind of...

28
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,870
Been a while, old man.

29
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,620
What are you doing out here?

30
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,410
I am a foe to otherworldly beings.

31
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,190
You will soon learn what lies ahead.

32
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,690
There's an Apostle nearby?

33
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,510
Or their root cause.

34
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,120
You don't mean...

35
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,290
They're...

36
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,200
The God Hand is here?

37
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,580
Did you not also see the shining
hawk in your dreams?

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,120
That was a revelation.

39
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,410
That someone, who signifies the hawk,
will appear in this mortal world.

40
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,980
The hawk...

41
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,210
The hawk?

42
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,700
The flocks of sheep are being guided
to a blood-stained holy land.

43
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,990
What they seek is a hawk of light.

44
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,170
When the place of power attains a critical
threshold, what normally lies in

45
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,980
the realm of gods is incarnated,
once every thousand years.

46
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,430
You and the girl will find yourselves
thrown into that maelstrom,

47
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,570
as though tracing a passage through time.

48
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,780
The Eclipse...

49
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,120
An event similar to the Eclipse is about to occur.

50
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,150
It's about to...

51
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,760
It's going to happen again?

52
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,140
Joy?

53
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,400
Unfortunately, no man possesses the means
to change this festival's outcome.

54
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,710
A shadow will be born.

55
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,530
It will simply be a shadow cast by a dying
sun that shines on a faraway land.

56
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,190
You're saying the outcome will
be the same as last time?

57
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,350
That we are both here, without meaning to be,

58
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,300
is proof beyond reproach.

59
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,980
We are already caught in the whorls of karma.

60
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,730
Shadows, karma... Like I give a damn.

61
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,750
In the past, I borrowed your powers, sure.

62
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,760
But this time, I will draw on my
own strength to save her!

63
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,770
And I'll...

64
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,500
Perhaps that brand will be of assistance to you.

65
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,590
What?

66
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,990
A word of advice.

67
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,830
Do not have more than
one that you care for.

68
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:23,330
Man, what is our holy commander thinking?

69
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,490
Why is she kissing up to Father Mozgus?

70
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,930
Yeah, she sure has some noble faith.

71
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,820
Hey, she can hear you!

72
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,020
Oh, my apologies...

73
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,320
Please be more careful!

74
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,850
Come on...

75
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,370
Don't waste food.

76
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,900
Why is a klutz like him the officer of arms?

77
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,810
Sorry.

78
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,840
Because he wags his tail and falls over
himself to please her, that's why.

79
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,470
Anyway, we have even more of them now.

80
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,510
More what?

81
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,980
Refugees.

82
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,920
A-Ah, where is Father Mozgus?

83
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,310
I will come with you.

84
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,670
I was just on my way to the chapel to call him.

85
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,250
Did we shock you?

86
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,510
Er, no...

87
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:39,230
All of us have been persecuted
because of our appearances.

88
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,030
Exiled from villages and towns,

89
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,050
we were reviled as monsters.

90
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,550
Some even lived in hiding, in the forests.

91
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,240
Please look.

92
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,580
I was born with a rare disease.

93
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,940
Without this mask,

94
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,050
I'd be burned all over my body.

95
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,380
I wouldn't even look human anymore...

96
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,200
God, I thank you for bringing us
here today in a fateful act.

97
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,390
Child of fate, find pride and
faith within yourself.

98
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,290
I do not like my work.

99
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,960
I cannot find it within myself
to enjoy hurting others.

100
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,900
But still, I am proud.

101
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,550
For this is a holy task given to me by God.

102
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,650
What is this sound?

103
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,680
It is the sound of

104
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,910
my master's worship.

105
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,480
Prostration.

106
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,190
Eh?

107
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,300
Every day, morning and evening,

108
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,430
Father Mozgus prostrates himself
before God a thousand times.

109
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,680
In the past decade, he hasn't
failed to do so even once.

110
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,950
He seems to be finished.

111
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,860
Well met, Lady Farnese.

112
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,090
Father Mozgus, you're bleeding...

113
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,620
Ah, excuse me.

114
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,490
This tower is a most sacred place.

115
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,140
A holy man, imprisoned here
by the conqueror Gaiseric,

116
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,150
continued to recount the king's sins
to God, even while being tortured.

117
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:35,010
Eventually, in response to his pleas,
an angel is said to have descended.

118
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,240
I cannot help but be more devout
in my worship here.

119
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,660
Thank you.

120
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,280
Because of these wounds, I can barely walk.

121
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,380
I can run no longer.

122
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,150
But I am fond of this agony.

123
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,710
My holy mission is to enforce God's stern law.

124
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:02,160
Regrettably, that means causing agony to many.

125
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,270
These wounds are admonitions to me,

126
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,670
as well as proof of my faith.

127
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,560
Are you having some kind of doubts?

128
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,030
I am simply unsure.

129
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,050
Will this mission allow us to save people?

130
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,280
The common people bear us only ill will.

131
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,380
And though it shames me to admit,

132
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,070
even some among my Holy Iron Chain
Knights oppose this mission.

133
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,350
Please dismiss this as a mere initiate's ramblings.

134
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,800
But I fear that continuing this way will
mean that terror spreads unchecked,

135
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,570
exhausting the people's hearts and minds.

136
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,910
You must not deplore difficult tasks.

137
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,230
You must not question God.

138
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,020
Though you may endure bloodshed,
in both mind and body,

139
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,990
you must continue to live for God's glory.

140
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,720
That is faith.

141
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,470
It is for God, and God alone, that we act.

142
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,740
For God.

143
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,770
And God alone...

144
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,740
For God alone!

145
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,080
Thank you for always doing this...

146
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,630
Don't strain yourself, ma'am.

147
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,460
Hey, Elaine!

148
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,940
Come on, you can't get yourself
all muddy like this.

149
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,470
N-Nina...

150
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,010
Joachim...

151
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,630
U-Um...

152
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,730
Don't you know what's happening to me?

153
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,230
U-Um...

154
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,690
Or are you saying you still want my
services, even though you know,

155
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,990
Customer?

156
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,740
I'm just worried about you...

157
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,580
Don't you get it?

158
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,180
I'm telling you that I can't lie with
you, even if you're nice to me!

159
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,650
Oh, but that's not what I meant—

160
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,000
Then try to screw me!

161
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,690
Oh, no. I...

162
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,920
If you think you're that brave,

163
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,500
come to the riverbank tonight,
when the midnight bell tolls.

164
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,800
What's going on, Nina?

165
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,610
Why all the racket so early in the morning?

166
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,440
It's nothing!

167
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,830
Do you love me?

168
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,250
Y-Yeah.

169
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,930
Then, are you willing to be
damned to Hell with me?

170
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,480
Y-Yeah.

171
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,680
If it's with you.

172
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,490
This isn't for work.

173
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,310
That girl. Could she be...

174
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,330
Come, let's go down.

175
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,090
I knew it. That girl...

176
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,090
This makes you hallucinate...

177
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,010
Now, let's run away together.

178
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,530
The goddess of flames!

179
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,170
Nina!

180
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,040
Come, Joachim.

181
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,300
Oh, Great Goat,

182
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,070
please convert this man.

183
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,310
Now, drink this, and become one of us.

184
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,240
Joachim!

185
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,520
Wa—

186
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,490
Kill him!

187
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,160
He'll expose us!

188
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,470
He can't have survived from this height.

189
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,170
Yeah, let's go home for now.

190
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,850
People might come because of the commotion.

191
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,480
Yeah, right... Liar...

192
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,520
Nina...

193
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,030
Luca, why are you here?

194
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,020
No, stay away...

195
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,770
Stay away.

196
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,270
Stay away from me!

197
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,490
Why...

198
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,980
Why are you looking at me like that?

199
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,140
I've always hated you!

200
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,390
Always acting like a know-it-all,
ordering us around!

201
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,970
I bet you feel good about yourself, don't you?!

202
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,810
You're a whore, just like me!

203
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,470
But how?

204
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,730
How can you look down on others like that?

205
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,200
I-If I scream, my people will come back.

206
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,990
You'll be torn apart!

207
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,620
Wh-What are you—

208
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,170
Stop!

209
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,010
Stop...

210
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,120
Sorry!

211
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,580
I'm sorry!

212
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,310
I'm so sorry...

213
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,680
You worried me.

214
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,650
You stupid girl...

215
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,440
Luca, I...

216
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,660
Joachim...

217
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,570
Don't talk right now.

218
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,620
Who's this?

219
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,620
Hey, she's a whore with Nina.

220
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,810
Oh, right, the crazy one who's sick.

221
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,920
Interesting.

222
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,750
Elai—

223
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,880
That girl.

224
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,510
Hey, show us your rotting face!

225
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,190
Huh?

226
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,280
What?

227
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,550
What's going on?

228
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,510
She's a real beauty, once you
look under the bandages.

229
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,490
Yeah, struggle!

230
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,850
It's more fun when they fight!

231
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,650
What's with her?

232
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,650
Hey, you guys!

233
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,660
Luca...

234
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,150
Huh?

235
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,840
What?

236
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,290
Hey, what's wrong?

237
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,130
Starving!

238
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,570
Wh-What's going on here?

239
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,750
Meat!

240
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,090
Meat!

241
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,430
Elaine!

242
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,860
Elaine, you...

243
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,730
A witch...

244
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,860
She's a witch.

245
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,390
Light the fire!

246
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,630
She's sure into this whole thing...

247
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,850
I heard the commander's family home

248
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,550
was right at a burning ground for heretics.

249
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,220
Since she was a young girl, she's willingly lit fires.

250
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,900
I heard she was allowed to search
for the Black Swordsman

251
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,680
because three years ago, she caught
heretics plotting to rebel against

252
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,460
the Holy See and burned them all at the stake.

253
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,680
So she's born and bred that way, huh?

254
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,670
I should stay away from her.

255
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,650
You, there!

256
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,290
No small talk!

257
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,090
Yes, sir!

258
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,640
Dad...

259
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,710
Brat, you're a heretic, too, aren't you?

260
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,680
The son of a heretic is also a heretic.

261
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,590
If not, throw this onto the pyre.

262
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,610
I... I...

263
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,320
That child is innocent.

264
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,150
We investigated him when
we questioned the father.

265
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,060
M-My apologies!

266
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,950
Oh?

267
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,210
I'm not trying to obligate you to me.

268
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,130
Hey!

269
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,720
Lord Jerome, I believe...

270
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,190
Oh, you aren't the officer of arms
for nothing. Good memory...

271
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,730
You're not so bad, huh?

272
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,480
Hmm?

273
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,270
That kid back there.

274
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,070
That was nice knightly behavior.

275
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,530
Oh, that.

276
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,490
You see, it's personal for me.

277
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,490
I was just like him.

278
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,430
My mother was also burned
at the stake as a heretic.

279
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,870
Three years ago, before my very eyes.

280
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,350
Three years ago?

281
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,480
Good work, miss!

282
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,330
Bless her.

283
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,360
God bless her.

284
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,910
I'm not wrong!

285
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,500
Shit!

286
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,380
That monster never gets tired...

287
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,160
I've finally caught up!

288
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,940
Casca...

289
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:01,390

Giving up before the job's done? No, thanks.

291
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,510
We have come to welcome you, Lady Priestess.

292
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,470
I kind of have the advantage here, you know?

293
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,470
Go crush them!

294
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
You call this a holy land?
