00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,480
What is this?

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,490
Stop...

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,910
Stop!

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,160
Stop!

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,000
Not again...

7
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,640
Da...

8
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,200
Danger...

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,180
You...

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,270
What the hell?

11
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,230
Danger...

12
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,730
Hurry.

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,110
There will be a pillar of fire

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,250
where blind sheep gather

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,990
on holy ground.

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,260
The hour of Heaven's fall...

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,030
Hurry.

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,490
Go now...

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,260
Danger?

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,960
Wait, has something happened to Casca?

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,470
Epiphany

22
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,210
Snow, snow, flurry, flurry,

23
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,830
spirits of winter!

24
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,110
Drifting from the sky, spirits of winter!

25
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,130
Dancing as they fall, like puffs of down!

26
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,550
Try to catch them... How mysterious—

27
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,130
Spirits of winter...

28
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,600
Yay!

29
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,880
I caught something amazing!

30
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,060
Rickert!

31
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,970
I found a goblin—

32
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,100
Hey.

33
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,610
You've grown a bit, huh?

34
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,210
Rickert!

35
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,400
Welcome back, Erica.

36
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,540
Good work.

37
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,900
You've bulked up a bit.

38
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,000
I almost didn't recognize you.

39
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,120
Guts, you're alive?!

40
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,420
It's been two years!

41
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,960
Where and what were you—

42
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,670
Sorry, Rickert, but first,

43
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,330
is she...

44
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,550
Is Casca okay?

45
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,970
What's wrong?

46
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,370
Casca's...

47
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,850
Casca's gone.

48
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,090
Wh-What happened, Rickert?

49
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,900
Guts!

50
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,420
Why? Since when?

51
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,750
Where'd she go?!

52
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,220
It's all my fault!

53
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,390
It's my fault!

54
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,540
Because I took her with me to find nuts!

55
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,600
It happened about a month ago.

56
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,090
We had no choice.

57
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,670
After so long in the mine shafts,
Casca was in pretty bad shape.

58
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,210
She was barely eating.

59
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,340
Erica felt sorry for her, so...

60
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:49,280
Before I realized anything was
wrong, she was gone...

61
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,530
Rickert,

62
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,890
then why are you still here?

63
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,230
Why aren't you out looking for Casca?!

64
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,100
You know what state she's in!

65
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,720
You idiot!

66
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,270
Idiot, idiot, idiot!

67
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,200
What's with you?

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,750
You're the one who abandoned her
and were gone for two years!

69
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,840
You have no idea what Rickert went through!

70
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,780
He did go look for her a million times...

71
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,340
He could've just left.

72
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,370
But Rickert...

73
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,120
He came back.

74
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,470
He still came back here...

75
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,210
There's a reason I can't go.

76
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,340
Shut up...

77
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,640
I can't sleep.

78
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,040
Godo...

79
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,310
Is it a disease?

80
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,200
Nothing so fancy.

81
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,310
It's old age. Just old age.

82
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,380
I don't feel like listening to your prattle.

83
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,810
Show me your sword and false hand.

84
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,930
Chips in the edge, blood, rust, warp...

85
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,880
Looks like you've been
swinging this nonstop,

86
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,790
barely stopping for food or rest.

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,170
To survive, you can't afford sanity.

88
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,710
That's the kind of fighting you've been doing?

89
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,050
Two years ago,

90
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,720
when Rickert showed up at my door,
all of you grievously injured...

91
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,890
I still don't know what happened to you.

92
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,420
Given the monster that came after you,

93
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,740
I'm sure it was something abhorrent.

94
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,770
But vengeance and repaying blood debts?

95
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,260
Don't you think you're running away to battle?

96
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,990
To your hatred?

97
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:36,780
Hatred is where you turn when
you can't face your grief.

98
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,960
Vengeance is like sharpening a blood-stained,

99
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,880
rusty sword in a pool of blood.

100
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,290
The more you sharpen it, the more rust
builds up, so you sharpen it again.

101
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,890
Ultimately, all that remains is a
shattered pile of powdered rust.

102
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,020
You don't understand.

103
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,780
You can't understand.

104
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,640
Not here, where it's nice and cozy.

105
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,430
Not when you're about to kick the bucket,

106
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,570
acting like you have no unfinished business.

107
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,960
No one,

108
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,440
no human being,

109
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,780
can understand what happened.

110
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,730
They all died.

111
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,040
Every single one of them.

112
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,890
Without reason.

113
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,750
Without warning...

114
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,510
Without justice.

115
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,790
They died like vermin!

116
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,840
They died ignorant...

117
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,720
In that instant,

118
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,250
those who were irreplaceable to me...

119
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,320
To leave by yourself,

120
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,230
you cast aside those irreplaceable people.

121
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,540
Two years ago,

122
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,060
you went alone, leaving the remaining
irreplaceable people,

123
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,740
broken after unimaginable suffering.

124
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,420
You fled to be alone,

125
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,780
to use your personal hatred
to burn your very self.

126
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,130
Am I wrong?

127
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,170
You abandoned that girl.

128
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,570
Do you have the right to speak
of vengeance for your fallen?

129
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,540
When it really matters,

130
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,760
you lean on war for your actions.

131
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,980
You're an unsheathed sword,
whose blade has countless nicks.

132
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,110
It glistens with blood, encroached by rust.

133
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,540
A half-broken blade, with a lethal crack...

134
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,160
Hurry!

135
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,430
This way!

136
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,970
See? Over there!

137
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,430
What are they?

138
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,290
Graves.

139
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,600
It just gives me peace of mind.

140
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,600
I forge the swords to serve
as their grave markers.

141
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,960
It isn't as if anyone actually rests under them.

142
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,050
There aren't nearly enough for all of them,

143
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,670
but we often did this on the battlefield, right?

144
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,650
Two years...

145
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,250
More than enough time for someone to change.

146
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,890
While I remained mired in hatred,

147
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,470
Rickert did this.

148
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,120
He accepted their deaths.

149
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,440
He mourned and found a new way of life.

150
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,300
It's just like him, this vigorous strength.

151
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,690
I know I'm safe here,

152
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,480
but without my sword,
I can't sleep in the dark.

153
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,980
No...

154
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,830
I probably can't ever sleep at night
for the rest of my life.

155
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,550
You fled to be alone,

156
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,970
to use your personal hatred
to burn your very self.

157
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,110
I didn't run away...

158
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,110
I can't get away!

159
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,080
It's burned into my right eye,

160
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,500
that final terror and hatred.

161
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,270
I can never atone for this pitch black flame!

162
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,240
If I can't atone, and I can't run from it,

163
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,790
I must let it burn me.

164
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,120
I must let it engulf my enemies.

165
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,880
Keep bathing in blood,

166
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,610
killing,

167
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,740
and thirsting.

168
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,640
Forever alone.

169
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,390
Forever...

170
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,400
That's right.

171
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,470
I...

172
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,750
I left her in that state.

173
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,280
What right do I have now?

174
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,180
I abandoned Casca, who was
the Band of the Hawk itself.

175
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,380
I have no right to speak of
vengeance for the fallen.

176
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,240
You were captain of the
raiding party, weren't you?

177
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,840
You said something about dreams or whatever,

178
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,250
but you left for selfish reasons, didn't you?

179
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,130
You weren't there in our
hour of greatest need.

180
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,170
How can I call someone like
that a brother-in-arms?

181
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,510
You've left us, haven't you?

182
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,960
You have no obligation to go that far for us.

183
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,660
Take her with you, even if by force.

184
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,010
This time, you have to.

185
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,500
If you don't, she'll...

186
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,650
You'll fight your own war, won't you?

187
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,150
You have to go.

188
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,810
You have to go, even if you go alone.

189
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,590
That's right.

190
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,140
I left long ago.

191
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,440
At that moment, I lost the right...

192
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,630
I guess I started that war.

193
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,260
It's true that it wasn't what I wanted.

194
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,280
But at least it wasn't anything
that was forced on me.

195
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,170
It's a war I chose to take on myself.

196
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,000
But...

197
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,820
Even still...

198
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,950
Those camp fires back then...

199
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,810
They continue burning in my heart.

200
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,070
That's right.

201
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,500
Is this fragile, residual fire

202
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,330
the only thing keeping that black
flame from engulfing me?

203
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,350
Man...

204
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,440
Have I made

205
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,500
the same mistake again?

206
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,810
Hurry.

207
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,090
Go now...

208
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,550
No, not yet.

209
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,590
It's not too late, yet.

210
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,850
This time for sure...

211
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,070
I can't lose her ever again!

212
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,820
You're working hard!

213
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,000
H-Hey...

214
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
I thought you were asleep.

215
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,510
Well, yeah, but I'll just get
eaten if I stay asleep.

216
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,200
Oh.

217
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,640
Okay, I'll help, too!

218
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,940
As a power-up, let's add a drill
and a cutter on his false hand!

219
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,010
Well, that's...

220
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,780
Not a shoemaker's elf, but a blacksmith's, I see.

221
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,650
Master, why are you dressed like that?!

222
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,150
There's something I have to do.

223
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,600
D-Don't be reckless! I'll do it—

224
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,340
Shut up!

225
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,070
Take care of Erica for me.

226
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,080
Master...

227
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,940
She isn't my real daughter.

228
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,210
She was an orphan, who lost
her family in the war.

229
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,520
I only knew how to deal with iron.

230
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,890
But she made me into a pretty
decent human being.

231
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,190
But you know...

232
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,210
When you die,

233
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,970
it's good to plunge into it alone.

234
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,470
Master...

235
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,420
Tell that idiot not to turn into me.

236
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,920
How's the new armor?

237
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,130
The master readied it for you.

238
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,090
Also, there's a new weapon
that uses gunpowder.

239
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,020
And a new, improved bowgun
that doesn't require assembly

240
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,840
when you need it in a pinch.

241
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,050
Where are you off to now?

242
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,650
Have you heard of anywhere nearby
known as "holy ground"?

243
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,430
Holy ground, huh...

244
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,380
Now that I think of it, an old monastery

245
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,460
named St. Albion is three
days northeast of here.

246
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,350
It's called the Tower of Conviction.

247
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,850
The Tower of Conviction...

248
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,700
It's full of refugees.

249
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,000
Supposedly, heretics hid among them.

250
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,860
So now, the Holy See is sending
a grand inquisitor.

251
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,860
Basically, there'll be a witch trial...

252
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,430
But why are you asking?

253
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,780
Guts!

254
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,510
I think the possibility that Casca's there is low.

255
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,670
I have my reasons.

256
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,590
I'm grasping at straws,

257
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,250
but I have to trust my instincts.

258
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,270
Later.

259
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,470
I don't really get what's going on.

260
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,720
But I wonder what Casca's like.

261
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,060
Guts!

262
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,670
I'm counting on you to help Casca!

263
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,980
Promise me you'll come back.

264
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,920
Godo, you're a good smith!

265
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,610
I'll ask for help again when I return.

266
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,150
You and your big mouth, idiot.

267
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,360
Dad, you have to stay in bed!

268
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,740
I don't think we'll see each other again.

269
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,340
It's better than getting all weepy, for sure.

270
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,110
But when you're running toward a goal like that,

271
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,560
you'll let something pass by, unnoticed, again.

272
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,590
Whether you live or die,
you never get your way.

273
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,210
It's like a mass migration.

274
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,750
Disease and famine.

275
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,350
And now, Kushan's massive invasion...

276
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,700
In its time of weakness after the king's death,

277
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,000
Windham, the capital, was attacked and occupied.

278
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,390
Most of the retainers are missing,
including the royal heir,

279
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,060
Her Highness Charlotte.

280
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,210
When it rains, it pours...

281
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,550
Show some respect.

282
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,200
But if that's true, our destination, St. Albion,

283
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,320
is near the Midland border,

284
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,190
despite being within Holy See jurisdiction.

285
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,870
Kushans are considered our foes
by religion, aren't they?

286
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,030
Is this the right time for an inquisition?

287
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,900
If anything were amiss, the Holy See
would send new orders to us.

288
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,110
Until then, we only need carry
out the one we were given.

289
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,970
Yes, my lady.

290
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,500
Lady Farnese is in a worse mood than usual.

291
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,180
Is something wrong?

292
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,910
I-It's nothing!

293
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,650
Don't think about it.

294
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,910
It couldn't have been real!

295
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,960
I couldn't possibly do that.

296
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,470
It must have been a hallucination, a nightmare.

297
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,160
Right now, focus on escorting
the grand inquisitor!

298
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,540
Even if God never graces me with a miracle,

299
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,240
I need but pursue my faith!

300
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,530
God is too far removed from the likes of you.

301
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,700
No!

302
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,690
I...

303
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,190
Is it just a bad mood?

304
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,610
Those monsters...

305
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,570
I didn't imagine them.

306
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,940
It pains me to say it,

307
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,080
but the Black Swordsman is too
heavy a burden for Lady Farnese.

308
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,020
Not only was she relieved of her role
in the Black Swordsman's pursuit

309
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,670
after being blamed for his escape,

310
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,680
but the new mission is to escort that man?

311
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,340
Of course she's in low spirits...

312
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,960
Clear the way!

313
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,890
Watch out!

314
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,230
That's a giant carriage!

315
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,020
Shit! Who do they think they are?

316
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,700
Shh! Know your place!

317
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,970
That's the grand inquisitor's carriage.

318
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,870
Look at the red wheels, hoisted on high!

319
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,490
They're practically the banners of
Mozgus of the Bloody Bible.

320
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,930
There's no mistake.

321
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,920
The Mozgus?

322
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,290
The breaking wheel...

323
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,490
The skewering, water torture,
burning at the stake...

324
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,460
He's easily sentenced over five
hundred people to execution.

325
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,410
An exponential number more are
said to have died by torture.

326
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,620
He's hated by many...

327
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,960
An enemy attack?!

328
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,240
Die, Mozgus!

329
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,270
You killed my family!

330
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,970
My son!

331
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,610
My daughter!

332
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,740
I'll kill you!

333
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,990
We can't reach him through the refugees!

334
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,470
They've flanked us!

335
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,960
Show yourself, Mozgus!

336
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,510
Huh?

337
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,340
What?

338
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,120
What the...

339
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,700
Honestly, such a clamor...

340
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,880
God values silence.

341
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,710
Lord Mozgus, are you all right?

342
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,880
I apologize!

343
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,610
We were taken completely by surprise!

344
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,390
Lady Farnese, please rise.

345
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,390
God is generous to those who do His work.

346
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,520
It is fortunate that no one who serves
the Holy See has been injured.

347
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,830
That is due to God's grace.

348
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,020
I am humbled by your words.

349
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,900
I shall be diligent in my efforts from here.

350
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,880
And who may these men be?

351
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,980
They are torturers, working only for me.

352
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,340
After rigorous training and service,
they possess iron resolve.

353
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,160
They are always of great service to our work.

354
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,560
That is... very heartening to hear.

355
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,400
So, pray tell, why did you attack me?

356
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,380
Shit!

357
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,940
Let me go!

358
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,420
It was for revenge!

359
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,820
You burned the village, killing everyone!

360
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,240
You claimed it was a sanctuary for heretics!

361
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,180
I merely meted out impartial judgment,
in accordance with God's teachings—

362
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,370
How can you call it impartial?!

363
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,920
We only said we had to temporarily
suspend our tithes

364
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,190
because famine had exhausted our food stores!

365
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,440
But you ignored what we said!

366
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,570
Divine punishment...

367
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,390
You will face divine punishment!

368
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,970
Divine punishment...

369
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,670
Divine punishment?

370
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,200
How dare you speak of divine punishment,

371
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,330
you reprobate?!

372
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,080
You are an apostate, who dares turn on a cleric!

373
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,160
And you speak of divine punishment,

374
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,040
you depraved lot?

375
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,720
Nay, none other than our Holy See

376
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,540
has the right to speak for God in this world!

377
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,650
Lady Farnese...

378
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,600
Y-Yes?

379
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,350
What would you deem appropriate
punishment for ones such as they?

380
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,120
Those who plan to murder a man of
the cloth are typically condemned

381
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,990
to execution by fire or the breaking wheel.

382
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,860
You are most wise, Commander of
the Holy Iron Chain Knights.

383
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,090
That is most perceptive.

384
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,730
Then let us conduct a simplified trial here.

385
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,370
Here is my judgment.

386
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,850
All the accused are condemned
to the breaking wheel.

387
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,920
Forgive me!

388
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,420
Please! No!

389
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,640
N-Next.

390
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,860
Next!

391
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:45,990
Hey!

392
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,050
Help me!

393
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:50,760
Hey...

394
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,240
Don't involve yourself.

395
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,000
Hey, girl!

396
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,100
Are you one of them?

397
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,250
Wait! She isn't with them at all!

398
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,210
Shut up!

399
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,250
Come with us, too—

400
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,360
Wh-What, is she addled?

401
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Hey, come!

402
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,510
Mercy!

403
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,780
No!

404
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,290
My name is Luca.

405
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,460
Are you okay?

406
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,180
What a gruesome spectacle.

407
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,920
I feel nauseated.

408
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,670
If you watch, you'll just be sickened.

409
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,740
Come.

410
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,420

411
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,420
What an unexpected test of my blade.

412
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,510
I'm not a fan of being mocked.

413
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,470
I'm... I'm scared of everything!

414
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,470
The Kushans have no mercy, even for kids.

415
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
Heretics.

416
