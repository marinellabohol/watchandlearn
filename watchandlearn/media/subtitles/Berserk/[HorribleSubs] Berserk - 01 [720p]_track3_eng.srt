1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's time to work.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over here, hey!

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
Edited at https://subtitletools.com

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, are you listening to me?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't stop at punches next time!

7
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,400
On that day, a dying sun rose above
the multitude of nations.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,670
What's this?

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,210
As written in the Book of Revelations,

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,680
"When the sun has died five times,

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,530
a red lake will emerge to the west of a city

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,140
with a name both new and old."

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,280
"It will be the sign that the fifth angel
has descended upon this world.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,660
The angel is the Hawk of Darkness.

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,200
He is the master of the sinful black sheep.

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,010
And the king of the blind white sheep.

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,040
He will usher in an age of darkness
to cover the world."

18
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,680
The Branded Swordsman

19
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,620
Hey, boy!

20
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,350
Bring more ale! Now!

21
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,340
Shit...

22
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,110
Why me?

23
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,040
What about our food?

24
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,200
Shut up!

25
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,520
Quit makin' me rush!

26
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,080
H-Hey, watch out!

27
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,990
Quit your twitching!

28
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,460
How're we s'posed to hit you?

29
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,460
I can't get free...

30
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,400
Come on, keep the knives coming! Next!

31
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,720
The fight's on, moron.

32
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,850
Untie me!

33
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,150
I'll bite right through your arteries!

34
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,070
I'll knock that wagging tongue
right back into your skull.

35
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,250
No, thanks! No, no, no!

36
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,430
Hey.

37
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,500
Huh?

38
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,110
Are you trying to make me clean up corpses?

39
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,040
What if we are?

40
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,280
I came with you guys because
I heard you were mercs.

41
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,000
But you're just acting like thugs and bandits!

42
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,500
I want to make a name with my sword!

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,560
Oh?

44
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,760
Anyway, I can't do this anymore!

45
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,850
Don't be so full of yourself, you sniveling brat!

46
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,180
After everything you just said,

47
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,770
you think you'll get out of this in one piece?

48
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,900
Screw you, asshole—

49
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,350
You'll be our next target.

50
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,490
Hey.

51
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,250
Yeah?

52
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,450
You're in the way.

53
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,780
Can you get going?

54
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,720
Huh?

55
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,450
Who do you think you're talkin' to—

56
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,530
You bastard!

57
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,770
Who do you think you are?

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,130
Wha?

59
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,530
Sorry for the ruckus.

60
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,590
Also, can you fill this with water?

61
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,530
And a bottle of rum.

62
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,440
S-Sure.

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,130
Hmm...

64
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,610
Oh!

65
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,200
There you are!

66
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,700
After you help someone, don't abandon them.

67
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,610
You should take full responsibility!

68
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,710
Oh, hey...

69
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,220
What's this heavy-looking lump?

70
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,540
Uh...

71
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,020
I'm Puck! Nice to meet you!

72
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,300
I was with a traveling troupe of entertainers,

73
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,600
but they were attacked by those bandits.

74
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,500
I've been stuffed in a birdcage
and dipped in a jug of ale.

75
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,110
I'm surprised I'm even still alive!

76
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,610
Um... Um...

77
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,070
I think those bandits have a lot of buddies nearby.

78
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,140
They have skilled men somewhere else.

79
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,890
If you don't leave soon,
you could be in bad trouble.

80
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,910
Ow!

81
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,680
What do you think you're doing, jerk?!

82
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,380
Don't gab at me...

83
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,680
I'll crush you.

84
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,090
Hmph!

85
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,470
That guy...

86
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,700
Crap...

87
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,370
I might've gotten lost.

88
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,840
Would you like to hop on?

89
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,140
It can't be easy,
dealing with this rain at night.

90
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm fine. Just leave me alone.

91
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,610
There's no need to refuse.

92
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,650
My daughter wishes to help you, too.

93
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,150
I'm refusing for your own good.

94
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,650
You see, I'm possessed... By evil spirits.

95
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,480
That's unfortunate.

96
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,520
But there's no need for concern.

97
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,910
I have God on my side.

98
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,660
And a spirit of good fortune.

99
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,920
Now, hop on...

100
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,430
A man with a black prosthetic arm?

101
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,770
I'm not lying!

102
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,060
I swear he had a monster's strength!

103
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,900
Quit your yappin'.

104
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,150
We get it.

105
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,400
We called in thirty or so skilled
men to wait for him.

106
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,360
We'll finish him soon enough.

107
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,010
In any event, couldn't we have
found a better meeting spot?

108
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,590
Huh?

109
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,950
Guys, did you know this?

110
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,920
Know what?

111
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:48,160
These parts used to be home to evil cultists
that worshiped forest spirits.

112
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,310
Evil cultists?

113
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,800
It's said they held sacrificial rituals
where they staked your intestines

114
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,980
to a tree, and then made
you run around the trunk.

115
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,220
This is one of those trees.

116
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,210
You should learn to tell better jokes.

117
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,180
The place feels haunted enough as it is...

118
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,330
There are rumors that monsters
appear in these forests, too.

119
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,500
Monsters?

120
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,230
In this day and age, there are wars,
disasters, and piles of corpses,

121
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,810
no matter where you go.

122
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,920
It wouldn't be surprising if evil
spirits and the like appear.

123
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,290
What?

124
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,920
I got here first.

125
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,090
I don't want to hear any complaints!

126
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,180
Have some, if you'd like.

127
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,930
It's wine we made ourselves.

128
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,190
It will warm you up.

129
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,000
No, thanks.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,970
But...

131
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,430
There are many dangers at night.

132
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,670
Jeez, don't waste people's goodwill...

133
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,960
Fine, give it to me—

134
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,390
Um, is that scar from battle?

135
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,930
I was bitten by an evil spirit.

136
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,600
Oh, no. Really?

137
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,410
Come, now... Please don't scare
my daughter too much.

138
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,910
What is your name?

139
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,160
Guts.

140
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,610
I am Adolf.

141
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,270
My daughter is Collette.

142
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,920
By the way, is that thing on your back a...

143
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,430
Well, never mind.

144
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,800
By the way, I was watching
you at the tavern earlier.

145
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,470
I don't approve of violence,

146
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,190
but saving the elven child was a noble act.

147
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,690
You don't seem to be a bad man.

148
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,270
Are you a mercenary?

149
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,370
Well, something like that.

150
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,200
I can't say I approve much

151
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,670
of a business that involves
killing people for money.

152
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,530
No, even to help another,

153
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,440
you shouldn't kill a human being so easily.

154
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,820
This is why I don't like monks.

155
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,330
Don't be that way.

156
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,640
My nephew left home, saying he'd
make his name with his sword.

157
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,590
Five years ago, he died on the battlefield,

158
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,470
just a nameless foot soldier.

159
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,720
If he had stayed alive,

160
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,120
he would have had a family,
and some happiness with it.

161
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,570
How foolish.

162
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,480
What's so bad about that?

163
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,230
No matter the cause, he died
doing what he wanted, right?

164
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,730
I'd call him a lucky man.

165
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,780
Though, once you're dead, that's it.

166
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,240
There's nothing beyond that.

167
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,530
Sorry, I'll be getting some rest now.

168
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,880
You'll catch a cold.

169
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,940
You won't be able to escape.

170
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,420
Griffith!

171
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,430
Hey, what's wrong?

172
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,970
Whoa, whoa!

173
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,420
What is that?

174
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,880
An incubus.

175
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,490
An evil spirit that makes people see
nightmares, to feed on terror.

176
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,950
An evil spirit?

177
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,300
Then what you said earlier...

178
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,330
What, you believe in God,
but not evil spirits?

179
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,770
Why is something like that here?

180
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,460
This attracts them.

181
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,610
A brand?

182
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,210
What's wrong?

183
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,220
Stay inside.

184
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,610
Incubi are born from bodies of the dead.

185
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,930
Long ago, this must've been a battlefield.

186
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,980
Evil spirits possess corpses and attack.

187
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,080
Given the incubus we had just now,
worse things may be out there.

188
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,290
Whoa, whoa!

189
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,620
Idiot, get back inside!

190
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,700
But...

191
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,720
Collette!

192
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,290
You should run!

193
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,670
You're free to go, if you want.

194
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,750
Why?

195
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,870
What's the point?

196
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,000
There are so many...
You'll get yourself killed!

197
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,940
That's nothing new.

198
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,650
It was far too large to be called a sword.

199
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,540
It was far too large, thick, heavy,
and much too crude.

200
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,380
By all accounts,

201
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,130
it was a hulking mass of iron.

202
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,660
Wow...

203
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,700
What's wrong, mister?

204
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,270
Guts!

205
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,990
Shut up!

206
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,270
I'm busy.

207
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,480
Guts!

208
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,310
Only twenty of us made it here.

209
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,530
Don't complain.

210
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,790
It's more than enough against one of him.

211
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,980
H-Hey, wait a minute...

212
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,790
Something's wrong.

213
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,570
Huh?

214
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,510
What the hell?

215
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,930
Hey, is that the guy who got you—

216
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,280
What the hell?

217
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,740
Guts!

218
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,570
You're too damp to be useful as firewood!

219
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,520
It isn't... your fault.

220
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,700
Huh?

221
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,550
Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right.

222
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,220
Only the weak get themselves killed
in someone else's battle.

223
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,100
If you can't even live your life as you want,

224
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,740
you should just die.

225
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,190
I'm a disaster

226
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,530
that those two didn't have the power
to protect themselves from.

227
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,430
That's all there is to it.

228
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,730
I wouldn't be able to take a
single step if I let myself

229
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,740
worry about stepping on ants.

230
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,770
It's no use.

231
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,500
You can't escape.

232
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,560
No matter where you may go...

233
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,650
...we'll be there.

234
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,260
We'll always be near you.

235
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,810
You can't escape.

236
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,140
We'll always be watching you.

237
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,160
You are mine.

238
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,200
You are ours.

239
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,320
Your blood, flesh, and bones...

240
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,470
Look, his ears.

241
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,990
His eyes.

242
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,520
His heart.

243
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,690
I want his heart.

244
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,910
As long as that brand exists...

245
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,200
Indeed, as long as you have that brand...

246
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,480
...you can't escape.

247
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,480
No matter where you may go...

248
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,600
...you are ours.

249
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,880
Your anger and grief...

250
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,100
Shut up.

251
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,200
Your pain...

252
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,940
Shut up.

253
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,040
And your terror...

254
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,050
All of it is ours.

255
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,300
Shut up!

256
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,550
So...

257
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,860
This is the world Guts inhabits.

258
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,990
We finally found you,

259
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,490
Black Swordsman!

260
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:01,410

261
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,420
This is the Black Swordsman...

262
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,510
His malice is unmistakable.

263
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,470
I am Azan, Second-in-Command of
the Holy Iron Chain Knights!

264
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,470
Oh, Tonio! He was a good man...

265
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,470
Elves have a strong sense of responsibility.
