00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,140
Hurry up!

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,090
Burn her!

4
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,480
We'll be saved if we burn her!

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,900
Out of the way!

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,500
It's just like that time.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,380
It's going to end the same way.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,780
Thank you.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,390
If you want to live, you will
leave this land at once.

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,730
As much as I want to get the
hell out of here...

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,400
I can't.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,840
Not to mention that it doesn't seem
I can do anything about this alone.

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,900
I might just be trying to act tough,

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,030
but I have to go.

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,780
I see.

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,280
Thanks for everything, Death... See you!

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,540
It's as though she's going to go
take care of a trivial matter.

18
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,220
Is that a fool's courage or...

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,800
No matter.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,550
Everything is following the
same path as before.

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:23,010
Unfortunately, no man possesses the means
to change this festival's outcome.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,900
We are already caught in the whorls of karma.

23
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,060
Shadows of Ideas

24
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,480
Soon...  Very soon, my life will also end.

25
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,340
That is when...

26
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:22,330
Ultimately, I want see my world
from above as it's destroyed.

27
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:30,360
If, like those inquisitors,
I had met that priest,

28
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,480
would my life have been any different?

29
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,520
Would I have been a someone,
who had encountered another?

30
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,000
But I met no one...

31
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,560
Actually,

32
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,980
I existed only to look down upon this
world from my summit of loneliness.

33
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,180
I believe that now.

34
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:02,130
This world that existed only for me to
look up to, as it looked down upon me.

35
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,450
This is enough... Let it all end.

36
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,900
This infant saved that witch numerous times.

37
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,810
This is a body of flesh, but it is not human.

38
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,300
It is dying.

39
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,100
You are the same as me, grotesque infant?

40
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,660
Let us go together.

41
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,770
At least,

42
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:44,190
you can dream, using the new world
within me as your cradle.

43
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,270
You stupid people!

44
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,630
You're doing the same thing as those cultists!

45
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,280
What are you going to do?

46
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,770
I don't think throwing rocks will work this time.

47
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,770
Hurry it up!

48
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,860
But wow, I can't believe we're all alive.

49
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,240
Come on! Walk faster, you cultist!

50
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,750
Listen, we'll run at the first chance we get.

51
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,000
Are you all right?

52
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,020
I can't believe we got stuck
walking with these two...

53
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,820
I don't think they've figured us out,

54
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,470
but I've got to think of a way
to get out of here fast—

55
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,880
Hey, old man!

56
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,760
You showed up at the perfect time!

57
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,590
Wh-Who's that boy? That brat...

58
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,320
Huh? I can't hear you!

59
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,520
Just come here, and help me out!

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,270
I'll just go see what's going on.
If you'll excuse me!

61
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,020
That stupid brat!

62
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,700
Are you all right with this?

63
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,100
Burn! Burn her!

64
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,530
Hurry up and do it!

65
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,730
Now, hurry... Light the purifying flames.

66
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,120
Father Mozgus!

67
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,370
The whorls of karma... However...

68
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,280
Hey, are you serious?

69
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,010
I've been falling a lot lately,

70
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,870
so I've been getting damn used to it!

71
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,020
It doesn't mean

72
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,940
all of it...

73
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,370
Now, girl!

74
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,650
...will be the same.

75
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,120
That will not be!

76
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,470
You will not escape.

77
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,400
On the contrary,

78
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,810
you may not be the shadow on the water.

79
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,520
But a fish that breaks the water's surface.

80
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,770
Something black just...

81
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,030
Father Mozgus!

82
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,270
Father Mozgus!

83
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,840
The great angel...

84
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,200
The great angel was defeated!

85
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,980
The great angel... That black demon!

86
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,400
What?

87
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,680
I just saw something from
the corner of my eye.

88
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,300
That's...

89
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,650
Casca!

90
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,640
Don't think that I'm gonna
let you keep stealing her!

91
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,290
Is an angel supposed to take a cut
of the action from a thief?

92
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,340
Another one's coming!

93
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,400
This brat is the only criminal here!
Please spare me!

94
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,300
What?

95
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,250
Stay back, stay back, stay back, stay back!

96
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,570
Old man...

97
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,620
Now, I've done it...

98
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,260
There's no way for me to get out of this now.

99
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,510
You fool who fears not God...

100
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,840
You will swiftly receive divine punishment!

101
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:10,020
In God's stead, I shall punish you.

102
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,900
Behold! Father Mozgus has revived!

103
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,780
He plans to fight that demon for our sakes!

104
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,610
Father Mozgus... Your form...

105
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,280
An angel?

106
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,540
No, more like a monster.

107
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:29,140
No matter how much of your evil
strength you use, it is futile.

108
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,630
Behold!

109
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,340
This is what deflected that impure blade.

110
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,290
This is the source of my faith!

111
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:46,060
As long as I hold the scripture to me,
harming my body is impossible.

112
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,320
The scripture's been cut through...

113
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,820
So that monster's basically just super hard?

114
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,410
You twins! Capture the witch!

115
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,530
The rest can die by the saw.

116
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,580
Hey!

117
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,290
The fact that you still live

118
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:11,020
means that my four disciples have
been summoned to Heaven...

119
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:24,010
I shall tear you limb from limb
as a tribute to them!

120
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,360
His strength equals that of an apostle.
And he's even tougher.

121
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,420
Come, mighty strength!
Come, superhuman strength!

122
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,110
Shit! They're coming again!

123
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,740
Now, now, if you don't pay attention...

124
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,410
God Thousand-Strike Cannon.

125
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,750
God Breath!

126
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,400
I'll shut that mouth of yours, so you
never utter a stupid sermon again.

127
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,610
How's that?

128
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,070
That will not suffice...

129
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,000
to cut through the armor I have received

130
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,250
from God!

131
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,230
He probably won't have a chance
to lend us a hand...

132
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,320
Quit whining!

133
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,030
Thanks to Guts, we only need
to deal with two of them.

134
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,240
And whose fault is it that I'm
in this mess? Damn it...

135
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,870
If I stay here any longer, I'll be
killed along with them.

136
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,670
I'm sorry, Elaine!

137
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,930
You idiot!

138
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,890
No, wait.

139
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,940
Are you all right?!

140
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,650
She's alive. I still feel her presence.

141
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,240
Hey, stop...

142
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,030
Damn it, they're just hovering above us!

143
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,700
If we could just stop their
movement for a second...

144
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,160
Leave that to me!

145
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,670
I'm not doing it anymore.

146
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,090
Wait! At this rate, I wouldn't
mind help from an elf!

147
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,130
At this rate?

148
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,510
Well, sorry! Look, they're coming!
What're you gonna do?!

149
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,680
Mark this well, monkey child!

150
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,390
Behold the sight of the true ruler of the skies!

151
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,100
Puck Spark!

152
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
He actually...

153
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,190
did it!

154
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,250
You're truly a terrifying brat.

155
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,080
The twins... How dare you?

156
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,050
Curse you!

157
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,550
Do you not fear God?

158
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,390
You dare get in the way of my
holy mission, you devils?

159
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,890
If you want to appease your God so much,

160
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,600
why not split your head open and offer it up?!

161
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,520
I won't let you lay another
finger on that woman.

162
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,700
It's moving again!

163
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,000
Father Mozgus!

164
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,290
Save us!

165
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,380
Oh, God!

166
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,790
Great angel!

167
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,090
Save us!

168
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,680
God Thousand-Strike Cannon.

169
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,100
I can't dodge completely.

170
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,520
And my attacks have no effect.

171
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,140
What am I supposed to...

172
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,660
It feels like being punched by a boulder.

173
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,920
Can you not hear those voices praying?

174
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,170
All of those here, right now,

175
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,420
have made their hearts one,
praying for salvation.

176
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,640
Are you saying you do not care
if the lives of the thousands

177
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,940
of true believers are lost in
exchange for that evil witch's life?

178
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,060
Stop being so pretentious!

179
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,150
How will burning the lady
save all those idiots?

180
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,150
Please hurry!

181
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,190
Please burn the witch!

182
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,180
Shut the hell up.

183
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,950
All they do is pray...

184
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,710
When they're in trouble,

185
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:47,170
all they do is try to save themselves...

186
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,930
Those tens of thousands don't have the
right to depend on a single woman!

187
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,600
Prayer is the sign of faith itself!

188
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
You must pray and offer yourself to God.

189
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,310
That is true faith!

190
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,360
You brazen fool, who knows not prayer,

191
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,610
repent!

192
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,550
God Pressure!

193
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,560
An unbeliever like you will
never witness miracles.

194
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,320
Repent by throwing yourself
into the purifying flames!

195
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,820
I tend to act first,

196
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,290
rather than wait for some great miracle...

197
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,080
I think your scripture
is about to let you down.

198
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You're protecting yourself with
what you believe in most.

199
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,970
But if you look at it another way,
that's your weak point.

200
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,200
If you meet your God, say this for me...

201
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,490
Leave me the hell alone!

202
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,830
Oh, God... I am coming home to you...

203
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:54,090
Allow me, at least, to... take this
heathen with me!

204
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,220
I'm gonna pass.

205
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,600
It's your time to shine for your faith in God.

206
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,430
But I'll be punished if I intrude.

207
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,110
Fly up to heaven...

208
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,490
by your own damned self!

209
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,890
N-No!

210
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,950
Oh, God!

211
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,080
It hurts!

212
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,080
Why?

213
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Someone...

214
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,210
It's so dark.

215
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,120
Starving...

216
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,920
Damn it!

217
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,170
Damn...

218
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,550
Kill her!

219
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,470
Kill that woman!

220
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,300
Please!

221
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,800
Would you shut your...

222
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,640
You fool!

223
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,850
Hurry!

224
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,690
Casca, are you okay?

225
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,030
Whoa! Casca!

226
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,550
The tower!

227
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,590
Run into the tower!

228
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,970
Head up higher!

229
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,470
The front's no use!

230
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,600
Head to the back!

231
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,060
Vice-commander, the masses
are flooding into the tower.

232
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,520
There is no other path.

233
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,940
We have no choice... Retreat!

234
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,520
All units, cover the masses!

235
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,110
But there are monsters in the tower!

236
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,650
It's better than being here!

237
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,700
Do not falter. Get as many inside as you can!

238
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,660
Vice-commander!

239
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
What?

240
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,000
Wait!

241
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,210
Many people are still out here!

242
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,500
Who cares?

243
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,960
Hurry up and shut the doors!

244
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,250
Shut them! Hurry!

245
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,050
Wait! There are still women and children!

246
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,250
Let us in!

247
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,760
No...

248
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,600
How could this have happened again?

249
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,140
Vice-commander, what should we...

250
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,730
Form up, and protect the women and children!

251
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Only those who do not lose hope until
the very end are true knights.

252
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,990
Listen well. Now is the time that
we show what true knights are!

253
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,700
Yeah!

254
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,700
Crap... At this rate,
it's gonna climb up here!

255
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,710
Maybe it's about time that I leave.

256
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,710
Damn it, what are we supposed to...

257
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,500
Fire.

258
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,500
Look.

259
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,880
I get it... The creepy-crawly
blob is avoiding the fire...

260
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,260
Seems he was more useful in death.

261
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,930
Father Mozgus...

262
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,520
If you don't want to die,
pick up one of those.

263
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,850
I don't do well with fire...

264
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,190
Like that matters!

265
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,520
All right!

266
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,860
Hey...

267
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,900
Rather than staying up here,
why not head into the tower?

268
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,950
That'd be like jumping into a feeding trough.

269
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,660
Most of that will undoubtedly
go into the tower.

270
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,330
No point in holing up there,
when that'll just break through.

271
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,250
Not to mention, it'll be dawn soon.

272
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,130
That thing will either disappear or
weaken when the sun hits it.

273
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,420
But there won't be any sunlight in the tower.

274
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,220
The sun will shine brightest here.

275
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,720
We just have to last until morning.

276
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,600
We're going to survive.

277
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,110
We'll cut through to our survival.

278
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,690
Cut through!

279
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,460

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
Being scared means that I want to live!!

281
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,550
I had forgotten.

282
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,510
That this is a world where the sun rises...

283
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,510
They're celebrating?!

284
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
Everything is being fulfilled by one voice.
