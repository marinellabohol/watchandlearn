2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,880
Yeah, struggle!

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,310
It's more fun when they fight!

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,110
What's with her?

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,100
Hey, you guys!

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,120
Luca...

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,300
Huh?

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,320
What?

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,750
Hey, what's wrong?

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,610
Starving!

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,960
Wh-What's going on here?

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,550
Meat! Meat!

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,890
Elaine!

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,320
Elaine, you...

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,880
A witch...

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,320
She's a witch.

17
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,030
Like I said, you're just causing trouble.

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,600
Don't say that. Please accept.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,750
Please give this to...

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,360
You aren't giving me a choice.

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,200
I'll take it, but I don't need the
attention in broad daylight.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,760
Leave for now, will you?

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,470
This isn't good...

24
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,770
Luca, what will we do?

25
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,660
At this rate, someone will report us.

26
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,190
Even if they don't, we'll be
noticed by the heretic hunters.

27
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,790
It's just a matter of time!

28
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,760
And when... When that
happens, what then?

29
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,910
I mean, I'm actually a—

30
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,900
Hey, Nina... Calm down—

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,910
How can I?!

32
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,250
Even if that doesn't happen,

33
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,930
if they find Joachim's body, I'll be...

34
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,020
Nina...

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,530
Let's abandon her.

36
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,170
Huh?

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,170
Let's abandon that girl.

38
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,100
Nina, not this again!

39
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,520
This isn't going to work!

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,130
If we let that girl stick around,

41
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,100
we'll be finished for sure!

42
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,420
It'll be fine...

43
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,420
Elaine will be fine on her own!

44
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,230
She's really special, you see?!

45
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,940
I bet my people will treat her well
if we leave her with them!

46
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,190
We've already taken care of her enough!

47
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,360
No way will I abandon anyone.

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,950
Not you or Elaine.

49
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,000
Luca...

50
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,270
Help, Luca!

51
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,250
What's wrong?

52
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:23,980
Pepe's...

53
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,450
Pepe's been taken by the hunters!

54
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,450
The Black Witch

55
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,170
No! Let me go!

56
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,350
Shut up!

57
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,730
We've had a report!

58
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,380
During your trial, you can contest
the claims as much as you like.

59
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,000
That's a girl with Luca.

60
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,000
Pepe...

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,680
Come to think of it, they've been
doing well for themselves lately.

62
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,130
I'll be raped!

63
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,150
I'll be killed!

64
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,180
Oh, God!

65
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,480
Damn you commoners...

66
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,360
Shut up, will you?!

67
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,320
You filthy lot never say a word
of prayer in your lives.

68
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,900
But once you're in trouble, you take God's
name in vain without hesitation.

69
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,810
How wretched!

70
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,600
How servile!

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,430
You shameless worm!

72
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,580
Don't be so high and mighty
when you're catching people

73
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,170
without risking a hair on your head!

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,080
Luca...

75
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,430
Luca...

76
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,340
Please have mercy.

77
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,840
Oh?

78
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,590
If you defend her,
you will also be imprisoned.

79
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,540
Now you're threatening people again, to shut
them up when they try to say anything.

80
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,130
You flash your swords.

81
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,100
You judge people from your comfortable towers.

82
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,360
Do you people think you're angels or something?

83
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,110
Is that all you have to say, miss?

84
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,950
Pepe!

85
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,530
Luca!

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,850
Who would dare?

87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,750
You're...

88
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,500
The Black Swordsman!

89
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,000
The Black Swordsman?

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,260
How opportune...

91
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,070
This must be God's grace at work.

92
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,260
We won't let you go this—

93
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,010
Based on what that woman said,

94
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,890
you seem to be the one
leading the witch hunt.

95
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,100
Answer me.

96
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,400
Among the ones you captured, was there
a woman with a brand on her chest?

97
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,650
A brand?

98
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,150
I... I don't know!

99
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,290
How dare you?

100
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,030
W-Wow...

101
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,370
He cut them in half!

102
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,020
Hey, ladies.

103
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,290
Let's get going.

104
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,400
Hey, your speech was pretty cool.

105
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,920
I think I'm falling for you!

106
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,780
Who's this monkey?

107
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,400
This is my property. He's Dropey, my villa.

108
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,980
Who're you calling "Dropey"?

109
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,640
And the one causing trouble

110
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,150
is Guts, my main estate, Black Iron Castle.

111
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,150
There's something...

112
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,310
...weird.

113
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,520
You call this a holy land?

114
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,100
What a bad joke.

115
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,930
It's more like a dump.

116
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,430
Sorry for my delayed introduction.
My name is Puck.

117
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,070
I own both properties.

118
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,260
None of this makes any sense.

119
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,150
Okay, please stay still.

120
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,920
My pain's going away...

121
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,200
Out! Out of the way!

122
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,200
Open the way!

123
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,420
Report this to the main troops!

124
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,500
Asking a peon's getting me nowhere.

125
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,780
I'll just have to go over there myself.

126
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,370
A woman with a brand.
Is that what you said?

127
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,250
Do you know her?

128
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,430
Hey, Guts...

129
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,830
First, thank you for—

130
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,440
I don't give a shit about that!

131
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,950
That's the same as the one on our Elaine.

132
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,900
Tell me...

133
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,440
Where is she? Where is Casca?!

134
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,440
Luca's late.

135
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,080
Is she okay?

136
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,310
If Luca's been caught,

137
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,390
what will I do?

138
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,210
That's right.

139
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,710
If that's what happened,
and the heretic hunters come...

140
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,390
I have to run now!

141
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,730
Let's abandon that girl.

142
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,210
We've already taken care of her enough!

143
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,560
I...

144
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,990
Why am I like this?

145
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,550
Elaine, come with me.

146
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,390
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

147
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,570
I can't leave you behind.

148
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,010
It's scary and lonely alone.

149
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,890
Casca...

150
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,390
I feel like decades have passed
since I last saw you.

151
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,630
Are you still the same as before?

152
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,330
The same as when you broke,

153
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,980
and time ground to a halt?

154
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,420
Oh, so that's her.

155
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,030
Hey, sir.

156
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:45,470
What are you to Elaine... I mean, Casca?

157
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,840
Hey!

158
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,720
Well, never mind.

159
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,300
I kind of figured it out.

160
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,070
Elaine! Nina!

161
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,770
Don't just stand there. Go inside.

162
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,700
Huh?

163
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,910
No one's here.

164
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,080
Oh, no! Were the heretic hunters here?

165
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,700
But the place isn't ransacked.

166
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,010
Nina's things are missing.

167
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,070
Wait, did she...

168
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,810
Casca!

169
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm okay...

170
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,140
Let's go.

171
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,100
We have come to welcome
you, Lady Priestess.

172
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,150
You...

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,780
Ha.

174
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,280
Even if we split up to find her,
this place's too big...

175
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,870
Dropey, why do you keep following Guts?

176
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,170
You're even helping him look for someone.

177
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,960
And why are you on top of my head?

178
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,250
You wouldn't recognize Casca on your own.

179
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,310
And you know what she looks like?

180
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,550
I saw her with my mind.

181
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,600
What's that?

182
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,810
Don't look!

183
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,530
Aren't you scaring the shit out of everyone?

184
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,090
They're all scaredy-cats.

185
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,590
Still, it's strange.

186
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,490
In places with lots of people, I should
become harder to see.

187
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,320
I wonder if this place is special.

188
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,130
Anyway, I don't get this whole
witch hunt or whatever deal,

189
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,370
but everyone's so scared!

190
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,700
Man, talk about a shit-show.

191
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,550
After running from the Kushans,

192
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,520
they have to fear being reported.

193
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,050
They're drowning in quicksand.

194
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,840
And you're different, Dropey?

195
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,880
'Course I am!

196
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,870
This is a great chance for a man
to advance in the world.

197
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,250
I don't need money to start, either.

198
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,710
This is good enough.

199
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,190
That's why you want to be Guts' apprentice?

200
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,540
You don't get it.

201
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,220
If I have to bow and scrape
to someone just to learn...

202
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,690
I'd rather follow them around and
steal their skills like a man!

203
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,890
You're a thief, through and through, huh?

204
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,880
Well, but if I do him a favor here,

205
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,610
I won't have to sneak around.

206
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,490
It's all about give and take, you know?

207
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,700
Hmm?

208
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,890
Let me go!

209
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,980
A bandaged woman...

210
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,280
Are they being kidnapped?

211
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,560
What should we do?

212
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,080
If we go back to tell Guts, we'll lose them.

213
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,150
But we can't take on that
many people, either...

214
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,550
For now,

215
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,470
we'll follow them.

216
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,840
Your specialty.

217
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,060
We have news.

218
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,560
The heretics' lair?

219
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,410
This one claims he managed to escape,
after being abducted by heretics.

220
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,780
Based on his account and
description of the place,

221
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,700
he seems to be telling the truth.

222
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,210
Very well, we shall go forth!

223
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,660
There is another report.

224
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,450
What?

225
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,270
Some of our men, transporting heretics
from the refugee camp,

226
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,190
have been attacked.

227
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,830
There have been several casualties.

228
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,490
How many enemies are we talking about?

229
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,210
According to the knights
who retreated, only one.

230
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,090
What?

231
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,840
A giant man in black, with a
sword as long as he is tall.

232
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,590
The Black Swordsman...

233
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,660
Is this true?

234
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,660
Yes, sir. We believe so.

235
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,040
This must be God's hand at work!

236
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,230
We will not let him go a second time!

237
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,560
Unfortunately, we must ask you
to take us to the heretics' lair.

238
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,690
Of course.

239
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,110
Bingo.

240
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,150
Guess this is the heretics' lair.

241
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,430
Hear me!

242
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,060
Tonight will be a holy night,
which will be retold by posterity.

243
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,720
That tower has become a source of clever lies,

244
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,760
a den for swine who seek
to oppress and rule us!

245
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,910
But we know the truth.

246
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,250
We know whom we should truly worship.

247
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,020
We know who possesses true power!

248
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,560
In advance of the promised day,

249
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,780
our master has given us a sign tonight!

250
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,280
It's Casca!

251
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,040
That's her...

252
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,040
It is our priestess, the Black Witch!

253
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,520
She is the symbol of our faith.

254
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,610
She is a miracle in herself!

255
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,400
And on this joyous eve,

256
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,920
one of the faithful will be fortunate
enough to receive more honor

257
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,800
than she deserves!

258
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,700
No!

259
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,560
Let me go!

260
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,550
It's the girl who was with Casca!

261
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,620
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

262
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,260
I think something bad's gonna happen.

263
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,460
Rejoice, Daughter Nina.

264
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,210
Your sin, in trying to keep her to yourself,

265
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,090
will be redeemed by your act of duty.

266
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,240
We will now remove this one's heart,

267
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,490
as an offering to the witch.

268
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,830
After, we will have her consummate
her union with our Great Goat,

269
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,830
to become a true member of our family!

270
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,090
Shit's getting real!

271
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,000
What now, what now, what now?

272
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,760
If we try to get Guts now,
we won't be back in time!

273
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,010
Hey, Puck...

274
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,350
I'll buy us time.

275
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,730
Fly as fast as you can, and get Guts.

276
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,820
I didn't know you had actual skills.

277
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,480
Shut up!

278
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,930
I kind of have the advantage here, you know?

279
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,470
Oh, no...

280
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,580
N-No!

281
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,870
Oh, nice! Well done!

282
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,810
You think better of me now?

283
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,290
I'd rather not have gone this
route if I could've helped it.

284
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,880
It's a cheap trick for a man who's gonna
make it big with his sword!

285
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,300
A thief... who throws rocks...

286
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,090
"Isidoro" means "rock-throwing thief"!

287
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,300
I knew you'd say that.

288
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,190
Hey, you cultist asses!

289
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,170
Quit your rites and shit in that
crappy, moldy hole of yours!

290
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,870
I'm gonna report you!

291
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,460
Okay, go, Puck!

292
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,240
Roger.

293
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,940
Throw!

294
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,920
Throw until your iron left arm breaks!

295
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,820
Make sure you talk me up to Guts!

296
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,750
Drag him down!

297
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,740
We'll sacrifice him, too.

298
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,370
Ha!

299
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,940
You worthless shits can't do anything
unless you're in a mob!

300
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,900
You're the ones to be sacrificed
to my ambition!

301
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,780
Take that!

302
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,620
Fools!

303
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,090
All critical hits!

304
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,090
Lots of rocks here.

305
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,050
It's been a year since I left my village.

306
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,700
Wandering aimlessly through areas where
bandits and Kushans roamed,

307
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,220
there were lots of near misses and
days with no food or drink.

308
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,330
But it's all paid off.

309
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,670
I have a big chance for the taking,
waiting right in front of me.

310
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,970
There's no way I'm gonna miss it.

311
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,350
As long as I can get through this,

312
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,430
I can achieve my goal!

313
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,240
I will win, no matter what it takes!

314
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,320
What're you all doing?!

315
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,140
That boy... What is he doing?

316
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,620
Elaine, let's get out while we can.

317
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,830
What's wrong?

318
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,890
What the hell?

319
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,820
Elaine?

320
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,320
That's the place.

321
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,960
Good!

322
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,480
Units one through four, follow me!

323
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,850
The rest of you, spread out
and cover the entrance.

324
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,500
Capture all who attempt escape!

325
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,890
Forward!

326
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,300
Subdue them!

327
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,150
Heretics!

328
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,570
Resistance will be dealt with harshly!

329
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,510
Help...

330
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,020
Wh-What?

331
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,600
What's going on with them?

332
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,770
H-Help!

333
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,740
Wh-What?

334
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,240
Who are they?

335
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,000
Vice-Commander Azan!

336
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,240
Azan, what is going on?

337
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,990
I have heard that heretics employ
various drugs during their rites.

338
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:00,210
Perhaps some of them turn men into beasts?

339
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,650
Drugs... I see.

340
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,160
Beware.

341
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,820
They now have the strength
of many grown men.

342
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,230
Drugs?

343
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,650
Could drugs really be the cause?

344
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,670
This is like...

345
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,980
It reminds me of when...

346
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,240
Special throw... It'll split
your head right open!

347
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,870
Yeah!

348
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,950
But... What the hell's going on?

349
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,250
The hunter troops are coming in droves, too.

350
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,210
Shit's really going down now.

351
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,310
You weirdo!

352
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,650
Hup!

353
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,340
Hmph!

354
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,200
Take that!

355
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,930
A-Am I gonna die?

356
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,230
H-Hey.

357
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,820
Okay, ladies, time to get outta here.

358
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,280
Who are you?

359
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,270
I'm Isidoro.

360
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,860
The details can wait!

361
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,940
Thanks.

362
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,120
But...

363
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,700
We can't go that way.

364
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,870
Hmm?

365
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,370
A-ha...

366
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,130
Hurry!

367
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,140
M-My horns are stuck.

368
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,750
Just leave them behind!

369
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,970
H-Help—

370
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,930
Lady Farnese!

371
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,150
This cannot continue...

372
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,280
We should retreat and regroup.

373
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,160
You're right.

374
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,500
A boy?

375
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,450
Why is a boy here?

376
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,540
This is...

377
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,070
An actual monster?

378
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,610
Are they all monsters?

379
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,430
It's like before.

380
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,610
It's just like that night...

381
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,340
You're knights, aren't you?

382
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,750
Hold the line and fight, cowards!

383
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,280
Elaine!

384
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,550
Man, I'm freezing...

385
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,210
Seems they're having a lot of trouble inside.

386
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,610
Huh? Did something pass through?

387
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,350
Huh?

388
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,070
You asses!

389
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,910
Witch...

390
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,390
Consummate...

391
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,590
Become family...

392
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,980
You pervy goat!

393
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,900
Don't get so excited!

394
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,460

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
No! Do not let him get away!

396
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,550
Baeeeeeeh!

397
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,510
I'm leaving Casca to you.

398
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,510
Luca, I can't. I...

399
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
Sorry to keep you waiting, Black Swordsman.
