REVIVAL

20
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,553
Ryuzaki, let me go.

21
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,888
Chief, I'll go with you.

22
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,933
All right,
but this is Kira.

23
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,895
Be careful when arresting him,
don't let him see your face.

24
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,191
Watari, if Higuchi makes
even the slightest move...

25
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,903
Yes. I'll stop him
without killing him.

26
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,205
Aizawa. Do you have something
to cover your face with?

27
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:03,999
Yes.

28
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,126
Cover me.

29
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,588
Yes. Thank you very much, Chief!

30
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,470
Higuchi, put your hands up
and get out of the car!

31
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,942
We've captured Higuchi!

32
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,655
Mr. Mogi, as planned,
give Higuchi a headset.

33
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,156
<i>Yes.</i>

34
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,784
<i>Higuchi...</i>

35
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,787
<i>How do you kill people?
Tell me!</i>

36
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,208
I'll use whatever means necessary

37
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,959
to make you speak
if you won't tell me.

38
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,550
The notebook.

39
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,927
<i>Notebook?</i>

40
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,887
You may not believe me,

41
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,473
but if I write the name of someone
whose face I know in that notebook,

42
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,975
that person dies.

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,520
<i>A notebook...</i>

44
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,188
<i>Mr. Yagami.</i>

45
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,650
Yeah, there's one
in Higuchi's bag.

46
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,528
He's written names in it,

47
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,780
but it looks like any
other notebook...

48
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,827
<i>What's wrong, Mr. Yagami?</i>

49
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,037
A monster!

50
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,831
<i>Calm down.</i>

51
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,959
You don't have a gun
on you right now.

52
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,086
Oh yeah...

53
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,255
Are you all right. Chief?

54
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,425
M- Mogi, can't you see that?!

55
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,635
Chief, you're probably tired.

56
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,055
What's wrong, Mr. Mogi?!

57
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,434
Oh... uh... I-It seems...

58
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,353
only people who've touched
this notebook can see this...

59
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,772
This monster...!

60
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,819
<i>Please bring the notebook
to the helicopter.</i>

61
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,654
Yes...

62
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,368
<i>What in the world are
you planning, Light Yagami?</i>

63
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,246
<i>When you take hold of
the notebook once more,</i>

64
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:12,169
<i>all your memories of when you had
the Death Note will return.</i>

65
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,379
<i>But...</i>

66
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,382
Ryuzaki, this is it.

67
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,894
It's a Shinigami... isn't it?

68
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,231
They... really... do... exist...

69
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,317
<i>Light Yagami, a notebook...</i>

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,569
<i>Show each other our notebooks
in Aoyama...</i>

71
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,655
<i>- Love at first sight...
- Ryuzaki, let me see it, too!</i>

72
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,407
<i>The Second Kira...!</i>

73
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,825
<i>Two books!</i>

74
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,204
<i>There are more than
two notebooks in existence!</i>

75
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,414
<i>This isn't Ô¨Ånished yet...</i>

76
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,010
<i>A Shinigami?</i>

77
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,971
<i>Write the name in the Death Note.</i>

78
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,349
<i>...and L.</i>

79
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,436
<i>lam L.</i>

80
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,154
Are... Are you all right?

81
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,282
Anyone would be surprised
by that monster...

82
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,493
Ryuzaki.

83
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,828
Yes.

84
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,372
I'm going to try and match
the names written in here...

85
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,916
with the names
of the victims.

86
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,671
Huh? Yes...
Well... Of course.

87
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,303
<i>I've won!</i>

88
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,890
<i>It's just as I planned.</i>

89
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,942
I relinquish ownership
of this notebook.

90
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,571
Now the ownership of
the notebook has returned to you, Rem.

91
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,197
Am I right?

92
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,824
That's right.
You're being persistent.

93
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,702
Then, give that notebook to Ryuk.

94
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,287
What?

95
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,080
Fine.

96
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,919
Now ownership of
that notebook belongs to Ryuk.

97
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,841
Ryuk, drop that notebook on the ground
of the Human World again.

98
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,886
Huh? Well, okay.

99
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,100
Now ownership of
this notebook belongs to me again.

100
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,521
Hold on, it's just gone around.
Nothing's changed.

101
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,815
Yeah, that may be true.

102
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,235
<i>But there will come a time
when this will be useful.</i>

103
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,363
This notebook,
the one I first received...

104
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,533
I'm now going to return it
to you, Ryuk.

105
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,951
Give it back to Rem.

106
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,873
Here.

107
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,839
Rem, give that to a person

108
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,383
with some status and
a strong desire for power,

109
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,844
who'll probably use the notebook
only for his own personal gain.

110
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,559
Misa will be released from
her confinement if you do that.

111
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,146
If she is not released
after several years, kill me.

112
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:19,940
How does that sound?

113
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,735
Light Yagami,
what are you thinking?

114
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,447
This is to save Misa.
Trust me.

115
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:36,414
All right. If Misa will be saved
I'll do as you ask.

116
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,419
Later, I'll make sure
to be confined like Misa

117
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,756
and put under 24-hour surveillance.

118
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,843
While in confinement, I will
relinquish ownership of the notebook,

119
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,097
and lose all memory of
the Death Note.

120
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,101
During that time, the killings
of criminals will begin again.

121
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,061
If that continues,

122
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,231
Ryuzaki will have to release
the both of us sooner or later.

123
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,571
Since I've lost all my memory,
I'll probably try to catch Kira...

124
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,533
Since that's
the kind of person I am.

125
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,620
And you'll try to catch the guy
who Rem gives the notebook to

126
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,289
and steal the notebook
before L gets to him.

127
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,833
That's right.

128
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,252
And at that time, I'll kill
the owner of the notebook.

129
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,754
But there is one problem...

130
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,966
If you don't have ownership
of the notebook,

131
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,636
your memory will only return
while you're touching the notebook.

132
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,015
Once you let go, your memory
will disappear.

133
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,147
<i>I'll kill Higuchi without
letting go of this notebook!</i>

134
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,899
<i>If I do that, ownership will
transfer back to me and...</i>

135
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,568
<i>my memory won't disappear!</i>

136
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,491
<i>I have to pull here four times
within a second...</i>

137
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,368
<i>All right...</i>

138
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,912
<i>I was wearing this watch.</i>

139
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,665
<i>Habits don't change.</i>

140
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,346
Mr. Yagami, take Higuchi
to the car.

141
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,767
All right! Understood!

142
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,812
KYOSUKE HIGUCHI

143
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,610
This notebook...

144
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,238
What do you suppose we'll find
if we have it scientifically analyzed?

145
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,699
That's not like you.

146
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,202
That thing is beyond science.

147
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,954
That's true...

148
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,762
<i>This is the longest forty
seconds of my life...</i>

149
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,780
Higuchi?!

150
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,989
Ryuzaki, Higuchi is...!

151
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,158
W What?!
hat 8 going on?!

152
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,787
Hey, Higuchi!

153
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,414
What are you doing, Dad?!

154
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,000
If Higuchi dies, now...

155
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,877
<i>Impossible!</i>

156
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,047
<i>No, but, he's already...</i>

157
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,385
<i>Yeah, he's dead.</i>

158
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,221
<i>Ryuzaki...</i>

159
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,224
<i>you're next.</i>

160
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,598
How to use it...

161
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,437
The human whose name
is written in this note shall... die.

162
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,397
This note will not take effect unless

163
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,900
the writer has the person's face in
their mind when writing his/her name.

164
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:37,071
Therefore, people sharing
the same name will not be affected.

165
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,949
If the cause of death
is written

166
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,285
within 40 seconds of writing
the person's name,

167
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,453
it will happen.

168
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,371
If the cause of death
is not specified,

169
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,290
the person will simply
die of a heart attack.

170
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,295
After writing the cause of death,
details of the death should be written...

171
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,965
in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

172
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,057
Additionally...
on the back cover's instructions...

173
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,354
If you make this note unusable
by tearing it up or burning it,

174
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,191
all the humans who have touched
the note until then will die.

175
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,734
What?!

176
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,444
Is that true, Aizawa?!

177
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,196
<i>- Yeah, that's what's written.
- That's right. With a rule like that,</i>

178
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,906
<i>- No way! Why didn't you tell me before?
- Father and the others</i>

179
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,491
<i>- How was I supposed to know?!
- won't try to dispose of it</i>

180
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,618
<i>and I won't lose my memory of this.</i>

181
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,665
Rem, there's no way that
the old man will get mad at us

182
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,959
if we write a fake rule
here, will he?

183
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,670
No. There are no such
rules against doing so.

184
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,132
Fine then.
Light, you owe me apples.

185
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,263
Man, I shouldn't have
touched it just

186
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,139
because I wanted
to see the Shinigami.

187
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,225
Then you'd be the only one

188
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,519
who wouldn't know what was
going on in the investigation.

189
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,187
Would you be okay with that?

190
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,733
No, I want to work on the same terms
as everyone else. Yes.

191
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,153
And...
this last sentence...

192
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,326
If the person using
the note fails to...

193
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,162
consecutively write names
of people to be killed

194
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,957
within 13 days of each other...

195
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,334
Then the user,

196
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,712
will die.

197
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,966
What? Which means that...

198
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,636
Light and Misa-Misa are
completely cleared!

199
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,221
Yes, indeed...

200
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,557
Light and Amane were detained
for more than fifty days

201
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,143
and are still under surveillance.

202
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,521
There's no way they'd still be
alive if they're both Kira.

203
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,898
Aren't you glad, Chief?!

204
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,191
Yeah.

205
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,527
Rem...

206
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,696
...was it?
You, the white-colored Shinigami.

207
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,491
Ryuzaki! That's rude!
Referring to it by it's skin color...

208
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,701
Yes, it is...

209
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,079
There are other notebooks in
the Human World, aren't there?

210
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,252
Who knows? There may be.
There may not be.

211
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:02,008
If there were other notebooks,
are all their rules the same?

212
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,760
<i>It's useless, Ryuzaki...</i>

213
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,929
<i>You can't break this rule with Rem.</i>

214
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,973
Yeah, they're the same.

215
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,060
There are many notebooks
in the Shinigami Realm,

216
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,936
but their rules are all the same.

217
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,481
Even the rules for when
humans obtain them.

218
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,483
Ryuzaki...

219
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,569
Light and Amane are cleared now.

220
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,488
Their surveillance is over.

221
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,407
That's right. It's already clear.

222
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,452
You're right...

223
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,547
I understand.

224
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,301
I'm very sorry about everything
that's happened until now.

225
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,390
Thank goodness...

226
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,977
Yeah, but we still can't say
that we've solved the case.

227
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,063
I want these handcuffs removed,

228
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,606
but can I continue to
investigate here?

229
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,775
Yes...

230
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,613
<i>Misa and I are now
completely cleared...</i>

231
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,909
<i>He has no choice but to believe
the fake rule that was written</i>

232
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,412
<i>by a Shinigami into
the notebook of death...</i>

233
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,623
<i>With the fake rules that I made up...</i>

234
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,542
<i>Ryuzaki's lost his edge.</i>

235
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,919
<i>Listen, Ryuzaki...</i>

236
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:25,007
<i>In any world, rules are always
created by those who are gods.</i>

237
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,052
<i>You will be beaten by
the rule I have created</i>

238
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,721
<i>and for the crime of
defying the god of the new world...</i>

239
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,348
<i>you are going to die.</i>

240
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,229
Light!

241
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,148
Send me text messages
every day.

242
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,026
We're finally saying good-bye
to Misa-Misa...

243
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,362
Hey, Matsuda,
leave those two alone!

244
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,406
See you later, Misa-Misa!

245
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,657
Hey.

246
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:57,373
<i>The surveillance cameras
can't see my mouth at this angle.</i>

247
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,043
Misa, I'm going to tell you
about a certain place.

248
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,797
I want you to dig up something
when no one is watching.

249
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,342
<i>Light, your memory has returned!</i>

250
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,012
<i>Don't worry,
Misa will do a good job!</i>

251
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,534
<i>Light, I remember.</i>

252
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:38,414
<i>I remember everything that happened
when I had this notebook.</i>

253
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,500
<i>You buried this notebook
so I could remember...</i>

254
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,088
FOR MISA, LIGHT YAGAMI

255
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:51,260
<i>Misa, by the time you read this letter,
you should have remembered everything.</i>

256
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,471
<i>A letter from Light!</i>

257
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,058
<i>Do you remember my friend
at To-oh University</i>

258
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,727
<i>who went by
the name Hideki Ryuga?</i>

259
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,940
<i>I want you to write his name
in the notebook... and kill him.</i>

260
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,526
<i>Also, burn this letter,</i>

261
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:11,280
<i>hide a few pages of the notebook
with you, and bury the notebook.</i>

262
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,033
<i>When you meet me again,</i>

263
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,953
<i>casually touch me with
a piece of the notebook.</i>

264
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,456
<i>If you do this, Misa Amane, I will...</i>

265
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,209
<i>- love you for the rest of my life.
- "love you for the rest of my life. "</i>

266
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,669
All right!

267
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,713
<i>I see. This is Light's plan!</i>

268
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,966
<i>He wanted me to get
this notebook,</i>

269
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,217
<i>regain my memory...</i>

270
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,304
<i>And kill Hideki Ryuga... Ryuzaki...</i>

271
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,477
<i>One of Light's obstacles will disappear
and I'll be helpful to him.</i>

272
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,816
<i>It's no good... Light...</i>

273
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,652
<i>I can't remember his name...</i>

274
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:55,157
<i>I saw dozens and hundreds of
names and life spans... every day.</i>

275
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,037
I can't remember at all!

276
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,455
<i>Misa's so stupid!</i>

277
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,502
I'm finally able to come back!

278
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,296
Ryuk!

279
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,673
It's been a while...
How have you been?

280
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,800
Sorry, but...

281
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,347
I'm a male. You're making me shy.

282
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,434
Oh yeah...

283
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,977
Here.

284
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,812
Light told me to bring this.

285
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,150
Is it really that delicious?

286
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,487
Yeah. Apples in the Human World are...
what's the word, juicy?

287
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:34,864
At any rate, they're great.

288
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,159
Do you want to eat one?

289
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,621
It's an apple from
the Shinigami Realm.

290
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,875
It doesn't look very good...

291
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,460
Come on, just one bite.

292
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,047
Oh yeah, Ryuk...

293
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,716
Do the eye deal with me.

294
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,722
Sand!

295
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,228
A deal, huh?

296
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,940
You understand, don't you?

297
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,444
You've made a deal with
Rem once before.

298
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:18,491
Do you really want to halve
your life a second time?

299
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,661
Hmm... Well, that can't be helped...

300
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,873
I've forgotten the name
I had to remember...

301
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,168
Light will be angry with me
if I don't take a look at it again...

302
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,672
Well, it's fine with me...

303
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,305
Oh, it's Misa-Misa.

304
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,182
The poor thing.

305
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,810
We can't turn on
our cell phones here,

306
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,521
so she has to
come here to visit you.

307
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,315
Light, go to her quickly.

308
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,693
You shouldn't make
a woman wait.

309
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,528
Yeah.

310
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,492
<i>Ryuk!</i>

311
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,744
<i>Why is he attached to Misa?</i>

312
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,210
<i>Misa's life has been halved
once more!</i>

313
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,630
<i>No way... Did she...
do the eye deal with Ryuk?!</i>

314
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,759
Light...

315
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,725
It's been a while, Ryuk.

316
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,773
Light, I'm sorry.

317
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,067
I don't remember
Hideki Ryuga's name.

318
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,485
I just can't remember.

319
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,488
I see. That's too bad.

320
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,783
But I did the eye bargain with Ryuk!

321
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,161
<i>Everything is going
exactly as planned... huh?</i>

322
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,705
Idiot! If you do that,
your life will...!

323
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,250
No, it's all right.
I want to be of help to you...

324
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,215
Misa, right now,

325
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,593
I want to live with you for a long time
in an ideal world.

326
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,428
That's how I feel.

327
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,555
Light, I'm so happy!

328
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,432
Misa...

329
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,685
Let's make a new world without crime...
a world with only kind people...

330
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,771
Let's make it together.
