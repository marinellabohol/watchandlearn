00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,506
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,217
<i>I pledged a vow to the revolution</i>

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:13,388
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:18,519
<i>I'm going to change</i>

5
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:31,198
<i>The future that
the forbidden fruit foretells...</i>

6
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>I'm going to change</i>

7
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:39,915
<i>The dream into reality</i>

8
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:48,257
<i>The ending</i>

9
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,510
<i>That everybody wants</i>

10
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,763
<i>Within the spreading darkness</i>

11
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,558
<i>I pledged our vow to the revolution</i>

12
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:02,437
<i>I can't let anybody interrupt it</i>

13
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:07,818
<i>Someday I'll show you</i>

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,363
<i>A bright and ideal</i>

15
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:17,202
<i>World</i>

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,006
ASSAULT

17
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,145
Next, we have
the Naomi Misora case...

18
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,981
Should we go ahead and
open a criminal investigation?

19
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,525
We should investigate it
separately from the Kira case.

20
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,653
We should avoid using photographs
and only use police sketches.

21
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,656
But she's already been
missing for four months.

22
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,742
She's probably dead already...

23
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:01,121
If she's dead, it's odd that
her body hasn't turned up yet.

24
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,666
If it does turn up,
we might be able to find a clue.

25
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,378
Ryuzaki. Turn on Sakura TV.

26
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,213
Something terrible is happening.

27
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:15,052
<i>In other words, we are being
held hostage by Kira.</i>

28
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,932
<i>Please understand this is not a hoax...</i>

29
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,728
<i>...and that we are not broadcasting
these tapes purely for sensationalism</i>

30
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,605
"Held hostage by Kira"?

31
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,231
What is this?

32
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:33,570
<i>Four days ago, our program director
was sent these four tapes.</i>

33
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,074
<i>Without a doubt,
they were sent by Kira.</i>

34
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,453
<i>Our ratings could go up sixty,
no, seventy percent...</i>

35
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,374
MESSAGE FROM KIRA
4 VIDEOS

36
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:55,133
<i>As predicted, they died of heart attacks.</i>

37
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,888
If this is true, it really is something
that only Kira could do.

38
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:07,646
MESSAGE FROM KIRA
4 VIDEOS

39
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,526
<i>It foretells another death
to prove that he is Kira,</i>

40
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,405
<i>and also contains a message
to people all over the world.</i>

41
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,741
Well, it's probably just another
fake documentary, right?

42
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,620
It couldn't be. Who would make
such a vicious fake?

43
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,247
<i>Please watch.</i>

44
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,673
<i>I am Kira.</i>

45
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:41,012
<i>If this video was aired on April 18,
at exactly 5:59 PM,</i>

46
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:46,184
<i>the time now is 5:59:47... 48... 49...</i>

47
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,603
<i>Please change the channel
to Taiyo TV.</i>

48
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:53,942
<i>The anchor, Mr. Kazuhiko Hibima will die
of a heart attack at exactly six o'clock.</i>

49
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,444
Change it!

50
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,989
It can't be!

51
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,618
How could he?!

52
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,245
Change the channel back.

53
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,581
<i>- Bring another set in here...
- Mr. Hibima continued to refer...</i>

54
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,958
<i>- no, two sets.
- to Kira as evil on air.</i>

55
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,418
<i>- Yes.
- This was his punishment.</i>

56
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,879
<i>There shall be another victim.</i>

57
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:18,508
<i>My next target is NHN TV commentator,
Mr. Seiji Kumaizumi.</i>

58
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,554
<i>He has continued to condemn me.
He is scheduled to appear live...</i>

59
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,181
R- Ryuzaki-!

60
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,682
Change it Channel 24!

61
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,227
Change it back.

62
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,608
<i>I trust you now believe
that I'm Kira.</i>

63
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:40,030
<i>Kira said that he was going to send
a message to the people of the world...</i>

64
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,949
Something terrible will happen if
we don't stop this broadcast!

65
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,869
Get Sakura TV on the line!

66
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,580
It's no good.

67
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,208
My friend who works there
has his cell phone off.

68
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,502
All lines at the station
are all busy!

69
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,836
Damn it!

70
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,130
Mr. Ukita!

71
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,466
I'm going to the station to
stop this at the source!

72
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,553
<i>Please listen to me carefully.</i>

73
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,389
<i>I don't want to kill the innocent.</i>

74
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,768
<i>I hate evil and love justice.</i>

75
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:14,314
<i>I consider the police as allies
and not my enemy.</i>

76
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,483
<i>Damn you, Kira...</i>

77
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,821
<i>My goal is to create a World
Without evil.</i>

78
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,783
<i>If everyone cooperates,
this will be simple.</i>

79
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:29,371
<i>If you do not try to capture me,
the innocent will not die.</i>

80
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:30,997
Damn!

81
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,792
<i>Even if you don't agree with me...</i>

82
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:38,672
<i>refrain from publicizing your views in
the media or in public. And you will be spared.</i>

83
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,675
<i>Also please be patient.</i>

84
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,678
<i>I will create a better world
for everyone.</i>

85
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:50,141
<i>I will change this tainted world
into a new one...</i>

86
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,227
<i>inhabited by only good,
kindhearted people.</i>

87
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,983
<i>Imagine it. Together the police
of the world and I will create...</i>

88
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,404
Sachiko.

89
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:10,078
Dear, this will affect your health.
Please rest.

90
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:18,044
Sachiko. I am the head of
the Kira task force.

91
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,850
Damn it! It's locked!

92
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,145
This is the police! Open up!

93
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,231
You... Idiot!

94
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,923
<i>- Hello?! Damn it, I'm not getting through!
- We interrupt this program</i>

95
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,799
<i>to bring you live footage from
the front of the Sakura TV studio.</i>

96
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,884
Mr. A-Aizawa!

97
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,643
<i>It seems
someone has collapsed!</i>

98
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,729
<i>We're currently right
in front of Sakura TV studios!</i>

99
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:23,485
U- Ukita! Damn it...
It's Kira, isn't it?!

100
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,904
Mr. Aizawa.

101
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,448
Where do you think you're going?

102
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,034
Where Ukita is, of course!

103
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,204
That wouldn't be good.
Please think about this calmly.

104
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,831
Are you telling to just sit
here and watch TV?!

105
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,378
If this is Kira's doing, you'll just meet
the same fate if you go there.

106
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,589
Kira shouldn't be able
to kill without a name!

107
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,758
So how could this happen!

108
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,886
Our aliases and fake police IDs
are pointless!

109
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,723
This could mean Kira already
knows our names!

110
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,434
That may be so.

111
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,063
If that is the case, it would be
a lot easier to kill off

112
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,482
all those who are investigating him
before making a move...

113
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,444
I deduced that he needed
a face and a name to kill, but...

114
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,697
from what I just saw,

115
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,617
it's not entirely impossible
that he may only need a face to kill...

116
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,707
All I can say is that Kira is
within that television station...

117
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:23,128
or is in a place where he can
watch who enters the building.

118
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,631
If Kira is in that area,
isn't that more of a reason to go?!

119
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,844
He may have only placed
surveillance cameras in the area.

120
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,139
If we go there unprepared,
we'll just be killed.

121
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,267
You said that you were risking
your life to catch Kira, didn't you?!

122
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,021
Risking my life
and doing something

123
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:45,025
that'll easily get me killed are
completely different things.

124
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,359
What?

125
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,826
Please bear with it.
Mr. Ukita was killed.

126
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,205
But if something were to happen
to you as well...

127
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,754
<i>I want the police to tell me</i>

128
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:09,382
<i>Whether or not they will help me
create a new World.</i>

129
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,677
<i>Please make an announcement
on the six o'clock news in four days.</i>

130
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,972
<i>I have prepared a video...</i>

131
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,974
<i>for whichever answer
you choose.</i>

132
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,083
What the hell is going on?

133
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,502
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?!

134
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,341
Where's the studio
they're airing the Kira videos?

135
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,801
<i>This just in!</i>

136
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,345
<i>A vehicle has just crashed
into the Sakura TV studios!</i>

137
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,808
That's one way to get into the building
without being seen.

138
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,810
But who would...

139
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,396
This is the police!
Stop this program!

140
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,731
W- What's going on?!

141
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,275
Stop the Kira tape right now!

142
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,694
W- Wait a second,
Detective!

143
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,240
If we interrupt it
we'll be killed by Kira...

144
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,286
Shut up! You do that,
and you won't be killed right now!

145
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,872
What do you think
you're doing?!

146
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,749
Are you out of your mind?!

147
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,055
All of this is happening because
you're treating Kira like a celebrity.

148
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,974
Don't you think
it serves you right?

149
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,309
Give me all of the copies
of your tapes!

150
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,395
And don't try anything!

151
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,313
|- | got it!

152
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,523
I'll give them to you!

153
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,316
So please stop waving
that gun around!

154
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,861
You've got a crazy look
in your eyes!

155
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,322
<i>Police cars have ﬁnally...</i>

156
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,575
<i>arrived in front of
Sakura TV studios!</i>

157
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,535
We're not alone in this.

158
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,830
There are still police who are
willing to stand up against Kira.

159
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,331
Mr. Aizawa.

160
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,751
You know Deputy Director Kitamura's
cell phone number, don't you?

161
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,050
Aizawa, I told you not to call me...

162
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,427
<i>This is L.</i>

163
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,096
<i>I want you to do
something for me.</i>

164
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,056
Watch the news broadcast.

165
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,351
You'll see the officers driven to act on
their own, to bring Kira to justice.

166
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,896
<i>If you don't take control of them
as their superior,</i>

167
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,480
<i>we'll have a tragedy
on our hands.</i>

168
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,359
But we are not supposed to
get involved in this case...

169
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,032
<i>Two of the police ofﬁcers
who rushed forward have collapsed!</i>

170
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,080
I understand, L.

171
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,750
Advise me on how
I should lead them.

172
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,589
It's from
Detective Superintendent Yagami.

173
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,133
Call him back...
And give the phone to me.

174
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,219
Quickly, get me Ryuzaki!

175
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:04,098
It's me. Mr. Yagami, so that was
you in that police van.

176
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,101
Yes... I just
couldn't take it anymore...

177
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,022
I've confiscated all the tapes.
I'll bring them to you.

178
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,399
How are you doing?

179
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:18,154
I'm more than fine. I've never
felt more alive in my life.

180
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,531
So what should I do?

181
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,576
I think going out from
the front would be dangerous.

182
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,578
But maybe I'll be all right
in that van...

183
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,580
Wait just a moment.

184
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,415
Deputy Director Kitamura,

185
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,501
Chief Yagami is the one
who crashed into the building.

186
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,378
<i>Are you prepared?</i>

187
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,046
As you requested.

188
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,840
Mr. Yagami...
Wait five minutes...

189
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,510
<i>then just exit
through the front entrance.</i>

190
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,679
Just exit through
the front entrance?

191
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,250
<i>Listen up!
Do not leave any gaps!</i>

192
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,335
<i>Do not show yourselves!</i>

193
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,629
<i>Kira is not in
the television station.</i>

194
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,423
<i>He's outside!</i>

195
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,602
Thank you.

196
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,730
I'll drive myself.

197
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,523
I understand.

198
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
Listen up!

199
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,659
There is a good chance that
Kira is in the area!

200
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,371
<i>Be sure not to show yourselves
while you're searching!</i>

201
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,919
<i>The police will reject Kira's offer!</i>

202
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,546
<i>They plan on ﬁghting!</i>

203
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,925
<i>I- I will gather up the courage
to say this...</i>

204
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,471
<i>This is right!
This is the right thing to do!</i>

205
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:10,350
<i>This is the right stance that
a country under rule of law should take!</i>

206
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,311
<i>My name is Koki Tanakabara.</i>

207
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,939
<i>I am NHN's Golden News anchor,
Koki Tanakabara!</i>

208
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,569
Chief!

209
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,987
Chief Yagami!

210
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,701
Ryuzaki... I'm sorry for acting
on my own.

211
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,537
It seems I got too emotional...

212
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,122
Not at all.

213
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:37,335
The tapes and envelopes
that Kira sent, are all in here.

214
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,545
Thank you very much.

215
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,632
Please allow me to rest
for a moment...

216
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,844
<i>Mr. Yagami...</i>

217
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,055
<i>Your efforts will not be in vain.</i>

218
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,183
<i>The postmark is from Osaka.</i>

219
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,895
<i>But Kira can control his victims
before they die.</i>

220
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,565
<i>He could have it delivered from
Osaka without going there himself...</i>

221
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,692
Mr. Aizawa.

222
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,986
Could you take this to the lab?

223
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,364
I have a lot of contacts in the lab.

224
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,282
I'll be sure to check
this out thoroughly.

225
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,617
Please do.

226
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,496
I shall check the contents
of the duplicate tapes.

227
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,585
Ryuzaki, what's on them?

228
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,462
They're very interesting videos.

229
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,340
<i>COPY 2
COPY 3</i>

230
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,012
And if the answer was no,
number four was to be aired.

231
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,015
COPY 3

232
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:37,311
Basically,
to broadcast more criminals.

233
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,356
Especially those who had hurt people...

234
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,900
Or criminals who had abused
those weaker than they are.

235
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,402
Regardless of how severe
their crimes were.

236
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,613
And Kira would play the judge
in all of this.

237
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,326
Furthermore, as proof that
the police are cooperating...

238
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,496
he said that he wanted
the top brass from the NPA and L

239
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,916
to appear on TV and announce
that they will cooperate with him.

240
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,588
In other words, get the top brass
and me, to show our faces

241
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:08,050
so that if we do anything suspicious,
he can kill us.

242
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:13,097
So, what if we had answered no?

243
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,601
Basically the same thing,
just expressed in a different manner.

244
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,897
Mr. Yagami, the answer is no,
of course.

245
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:26,194
Please give Sakura TV permission
to air the fourth video.

246
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,157
<i>I think it is unfortunate...
that your answer is no.</i>

247
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,075
<i>The police have answered...</i>

248
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,785
<i>that they still wish
to ﬁght me.</i>

249
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,289
<i>So I will ﬁrst take the life of
the Director-General of the NPA.</i>

250
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:43,669
<i>Or, I may take the life of the L
who is leading the investigation.</i>

251
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,716
<i>The Director-General or L.
Who will be sacriﬁced...</i>

252
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,260
<i>for the loss of a peaceful world?</i>

253
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,180
<i>Please make your decision in four days.</i>

254
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,484
As I thought,
god is really on my side...

255
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,153
Only this time, it's not god

256
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,321
but a Shinigami, a God of Death.

257
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,782
<i>So it seems.</i>

258
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,577
Another Shinigami has come
to the human world.

259
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,205
And another Shinigami's Death Note...

260
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,291
has fallen into the hands of
someone who endorses Kira.

261
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,378
SAKURA TV

262
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,716
So this Kira's killing abilities
are far more powerful than mine.

263
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,220
If I leave things
the way they are,

264
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,639
L might be eliminated
within the next four days.

265
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,724
But...

266
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,394
I can't forgive the impostor
for dragging

267
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,938
down Kira's image
with these dirty tactics.

268
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,774
If the impostor slips up
and is caught,

269
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,735
the existence of the Death Note
could be discovered... That would be bad.

270
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,363
I can't let them run wild
for too long.

271
00:17:55,366 --> 00:18:00,580
My priority is to cooperate
with the investigation...

272
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,125
and to figure out L's moves and
the fake Kira's moves.

273
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,048
Ryuzaki, it's as you thought.

274
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,468
Leaders of several countries
have talked and

275
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,388
they want the real L
to appear on TV.

276
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,727
That would be the most right
and reasonable choice.

277
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,730
Well, we still have three days,

278
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,857
so let's think of a measure
to prevent all that.

279
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,192
It would annoy me...

280
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,031
if I'm killed by someone who's
jumped on Kira's bandwagon.

281
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,783
What are you talking about Ryuzaki?

282
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,496
<i>There is a high possibility
that this Kira is a fake.</i>

283
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,167
No, we should call him
the Second Kira.

284
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,835
The Second Kira?!

285
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,589
W- Why do you think
there's a second Kira?

286
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,799
Please explain!

287
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,929
First of all, there are
the predicted victims.

288
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:02,099
They were used to convince
the TV station employees that he's Kira.

289
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,852
Those two victims
were only featured

290
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,064
in women's magazines and
on daytime talk shows.

291
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,485
The real Kira has no need to prove
himself with such insignificant people.

292
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:16,113
But in the Second Kira's view...

293
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:20,076
he couldn't use a criminal that

294
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,787
the real Kira might kill
before his prediction.

295
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,164
Hmm... Ryuzaki...

296
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,668
What are the chances that
there is a second Kira?

297
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,004
This time it's more than
a 70% chance.

298
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,758
I don't like the way he does things.

299
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,301
It's not like Kira.

300
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,552
"Not like Kira"?

301
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,722
Kira has always avoided
innocent victims,

302
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,266
aside from those who have
tried to catch him.

303
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,061
If we catch one Kira,

304
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,773
I think we'll get a hint as to
how we can catch the other.

305
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:53,901
Mr. Yagami.

306
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,072
May I ask your son to
cooperate in this investigation?

307
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:03,452
Does that mean he's
no longer a suspect?

308
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:09,583
No. I can't say that he's been cleared,
but I could use his reasoning abilities.

309
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,961
<i>So that's what it means.</i>

310
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,215
If my son wants to cooperate with you,
I have no reason to stop you.

311
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,260
Thank you. But...

312
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:25,099
please keep it a secret that
this current Kira might be a fake.

313
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,978
Please make it seem as if
we're pursuing the same Kira.

314
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,319
Hey, Misa...

315
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,905
I gave you the Death Note...

316
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,868
so why don't you use
it more for yourself?

317
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,245
I am using it for myself.

318
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,330
Because I believe in what Kira is doing.

319
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,292
I want to know what kind
of person Kira is.

320
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,836
I want to meet and talk to him.

321
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,923
I sent those videos to
the television station just for that.

322
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,384
I made sure
Kira would take notice.

323
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,430
I bet that got Kira's attention.
I'm sure of it.

324
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,849
This is a dangerous game.

325
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,561
You might be killed.
Do you understand?

326
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,566
It's all right. I'm sure that Kira
is kind to those with pure hearts.

327
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,443
But if it comes down to it...

328
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,613
I'm stronger because
I have the eyes!

329
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,160
TO BE CONTINUED

330
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:31,499
<i>I dreamed a dream
that no one could see,</i>

331
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:36,879
<i>I threw away everything
that I didn't need</i>

332
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,424
<i>I'm holding these feelings</i>

333
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:45,888
<i>That I can't give up in my heart</i>

334
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:52,269
<i>Even if my feet fall victim
to the shackles of sacriﬁce</i>

335
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:56,857
<i>In between reality and my ideal</i>

336
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,530
<i>I can't hold back
the ﬂooding impulses</i>

337
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,158
<i>Because I have a strong desire</i>

338
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,995
<i>To accomplish</i>

339
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:20,923
<i>I'm not weak enough to believe</i>

340
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:25,970
<i>Any of these negative perceptions</i>

341
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:31,767
<i>I'm a trickster
who doesn't know solitude</i>

342
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,107
PREVIEW

343
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,112
before anyone else on
the Task Force does.

344
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:48,325
What kind of person are you,
Fake Kira?!

345
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,120
LOVE
