WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

91
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,590
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

92
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,390
Eliminate.

93
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,390
Eliminate.

94
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,600
Eliminate!

95
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,190
Mikami Teru is a person who can distinguish good and evil far better than the average Japanese adult.

96
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,220
His sense of justice is strong.

97
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:56,760
And unlike the average Japanese adult, he has seen much unhappiness, and faced death many times.

98
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,430
Selection

99
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,770
In this world you are either evil or on the side of justice.

100
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,740
This is the truth I discovered when I was a child.

101
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,800
Humans are either good or evil. Everyone is divided into these two categories.

102
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,370
Humans are either good or evil. Everyone is divided into these two categories.

103
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,790
Even though Junior High was a small part of the world, it became that way.

104
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:20,220
As class representative, even though I aimed for high goals, there were always enemies.

105
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,310
Hey, stop it! Stop it!

106
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,680
I couldn't help but fight against evil.

107
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,640
Even though it looked like justice would lose at times.

108
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,320
But no matter how I suffered, I was happy.

109
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,570
Thanks.

110
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,450
Just hearing that word from the victim, made me want to help them every time.

111
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,710
During those times, my effort paid off.

112
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,430
It was verification of my own justice.

113
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,940
Don't do something you regret.

114
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,550
See, see!

115
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,020
But, that was only true in the world of children.

116
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,640
Come Junior High, fighting against evil only increased my enemies.

117
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,500
Come Junior High, fighting against evil only increased my enemies.

118
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,380
The victims became assailants, even spectators went on the side of evil.

119
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,330
Justice cannot help change things all the time.

120
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,650
At those times, we have no choice but to eliminate evil.

121
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,700
The only person who understood me, my only ally, was a woman. My mother.

122
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,300
The only person who understood me, my only ally, was a woman. My mother.

123
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,400
The only person who understood me, my only ally, was a woman. My mother.

124
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,010
No, it used to be my mother.

125
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,110
Teru, in this world, there are things you cannot change.

126
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,910
Teru, in this world, there are things you cannot change.

127
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,080
Please stop it already. They have no reason to torment you.

128
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,420
Please stop it already. They have no reason to torment you.

129
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,420
There's nothing to prove by acting this way.

130
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,950
You only look like an idiot.

131
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,590
What can you accomplish by working this hard by yourself...

132
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,680
My mother was wrong. She wasn't on the side of justice.

133
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,980
There were people who needed to be eliminated.

134
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,950
And then a miracle happened.

135
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,810
Four of the bullies were driving recklessly, all of them died.

136
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,880
One passerby died as well. That person was my mother.

137
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,750
One passerby died as well. That person was my mother.

138
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,000
The people I wanted eliminated were eliminated all at once.

139
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,750
I was probably afraid at first. My heart rejected it.

140
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:10,070
But the elimination should make some people happy.

141
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,070
The victims definitely... no, the entire class deep in their hearts...

142
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,980
The victims definitely... no, the entire class deep in their hearts...

143
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,980
The victims definitely... no, the entire class deep in their hearts...

144
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,050
I wasn't wrong.

145
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,240
Soon after, the classroom became peaceful.

146
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,200
Evil deeds will be punished, this is something that should be.

147
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,670
Evil must be eliminated.

148
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,460
Further, are there any mistakes in the book?

149
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,750
Yes, I'm really sorry.

150
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,050
After I became an adult, my beliefs became firm.

151
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,540
Everywhere there are people who have no worth.

152
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,520
No, because of these people, evil exists.

153
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,180
No, because of these people, evil exists.

154
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,340
And as they approached adulthood, they no longer wished to be reformed.

155
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,570
There's no choice but to eliminate them.

156
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,080
It's a mysterious thing. The people I passed judgment on were eliminated one by one.

157
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,160
It's a mysterious thing. The people I passed judgment on were eliminated one by one.

158
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,240
Was it coincidence, or was I special?

159
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,300
Was it coincidence, or was I special?

160
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,180
Those things didn't matter.

161
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,590
Divine punishment was brought down upon evil.

162
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,250
If it wasn't, someone would have to pass judgment on evil.

163
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,420
For that purpose, I became a prosecutor.

164
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,270
Prosecutors are figures of justice passing judgment on evil. It was my calling in life.

165
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,520
That's what I believed.

166
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,390
And at that time...

167
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,430
God descended!

168
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,070
All those people didn't die by coincidence.

169
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,070
It was God's judgment.

170
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,280
God was watching me!

171
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,080
God was passing judgment for me, who stood up against evil.

172
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,950
I realized this. I went to as many places as possible where God was watching.

173
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,090
I realized this. I went to as many places as possible where God was watching.

174
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,590
And then...

175
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,460
God was definitely watching over me.

176
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,620
Not only that, he found me worthy of his power.

177
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,190
With this, it's fine if I don't get a response from him.

178
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,420
I'll do what he desires. I'll carry out Kira's duty.

179
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,950
I'll do what he desires. I'll carry out Kira's duty.

180
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,330
Eliminate.

181
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,320
Eliminate.

182
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,590
Eliminate.

183
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,940
Eliminate.

184
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,030
Eliminate.

185
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,020
Eliminate.

186
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,070
Eliminate.

187
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,210
Eliminate.

188
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,290
Eliminate.

189
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,250
Eliminate.

190
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,030
Eliminate.

191
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,020
Mikami killed Demegawa before I instructed him to.

192
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,360
Now there isn't a spokesperson to speak Kira's thoughts.

193
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,400
I can't make a move in this situation.

194
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,690
What will you do, Mikami?

195
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,810
Kira hasn't sent any messages.

196
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,690
He must be in a position where he can't make any moves.

197
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,970
But this is an important moment. A spokesperson for Kira is essential.

198
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,920
But this is an important moment. A spokesperson for Kira is essential.

199
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,500
Then, I'll take the initiative.

200
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,630
Extra, extra, a new development!

201
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,850
Kira will be choosing a new spokesperson to replace Demegawa.

202
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,010
Please watch!

203
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,350
This woman...

204
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,390
Takada Kiyomi.

205
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,380
Good evening, this is Takada Kiyomi from News Six.

206
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:04,520
Starting today, I'll be bringing everyone Kira's word quickly and accurately...

207
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,830
So it's NHN's best announcer.

208
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,270
Picking Taki, Kira has good taste!

209
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,800
There's no mistaking it. She was Light-kun's girlfriend during college.

210
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,760
...report to Kira...

211
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,870
You've dealt with this quickly, Mikami.

212
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,640
But they will find a connection between us immediately...

213
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,050
No, his choice isn't bad at all.

214
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,710
She knows me. I can't send her anything.

215
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,650
On the contrary, I can get her on my side easily.

216
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,150
...address the country's preference.

217
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,650
I can definitely use her. I need to contact her as quickly as possible.

218
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,070
I can definitely use her. I need to contact her as quickly as possible.

219
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:43,450
Takada Kiyomi. I talked to her once when I was in a debate program.

220
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:50,540
She was normal as a moderator, but when asked a question about Kira, her expression changed.

221
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,830
She detests criminals and those that bring misfortune to society.

222
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,420
She spoke so profusely about it, you could tell the intensity of her beliefs.

223
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:05,260
After that, I talked to her in private many times, and she was undoubtedly a supporter of Kira.

224
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,690
She was the perfect person from the media to use as Kira's spokesperson.

225
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,780
Takada Kiyomi.

226
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,820
It would be reckless to choose her as the spokesperson.

227
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,530
And there haven't been any signs of messages from Light-kun.

228
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,120
Am I thinking too much?

229
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:35,500
Everyone, what do you think of using Takada Kiyomi for the investigation?

230
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,800
To be honest, she was my girlfriend during my college years.

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,480
To suggest this himself... so he isn't going to keep this hidden?

232
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,510
To suggest this himself... so he isn't going to keep this hidden?

233
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,440
Kira gives her his instructions, and makes her read his message...

234
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,480
Using her would be the best method to catch Kira.

235
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:02,740
But Taki is only doing this because Kira must be threatening her. Won't she be afraid to cooperate with us?

236
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,030
That's right.

237
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,990
That's not an issue.

238
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:13,000
I have her cell phone number, and if I want to see her, I can make it happen.

239
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,040
You have an amazing confidence. That's Light-kun for you.

240
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,300
But, it'll definitely be difficult to get her to cooperate in the capture of Kira.

241
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,800
I talked to her about a lot of things during college, but she is definitely... a Kira supporter.

242
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
I talked to her about a lot of things during college, but she is definitely... a Kira supporter.

243
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,220
I talked to her about a lot of things during college, but she is definitely... a Kira supporter.

244
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,400
But we can still use her.

245
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,430
Right now, the police are claiming they support Kira.

246
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,530
But in reality they aren't doing anything.

247
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:48,850
So, I'll let her know I'm working for the police, and ask her for Kira's instructions on what the police should do.

248
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,910
For someone who supports Kira, that won't be an unappealing conversation.

249
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,940
Will that go well?

250
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,630
I don't know, but we can only try.

251
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,670
It's true... We can observe what goes on.

252
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,270
Then, I'll call her right now.

253
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,550
Light-kun.

254
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,360
I want you to let us listen to your conversation with Takada.

255
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,230
All right, I don't mind.

256
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,060
No, I want you to listen.

257
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,560
We don't know if there will be any hints about Kira in what she says.

258
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,280
Y-Yeah...

259
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,430
Y-Yeah...

260
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,490
Hello?

261
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,090
Takada-san, this is Yagami.

262
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,080
Yagami-kun?

263
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,060
It's been a while. Why the call?

264
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,650
Takada-san, I have something important to say to you.

265
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,320
Can we meet sometime? I have a favor to ask of you.

266
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,050
Can we meet sometime? I have a favor to ask of you.

267
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,500
A favor?

268
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:50,510
I know you're in a position where the world pays attention to you, so meeting might be impossible.

269
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:57,460
But even if that's true, you haven't kept in touch with me.

270
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,060
That's true.

271
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,340
During college, I didn't get to talk to you as much as I wanted to.

272
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:10,460
But thanks to our jobs, we are able to meet each other again.

273
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,080
This feels like fate.

274
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,080
Because of our jobs...?

275
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,790
Right now, I'm working in the police, and there is something I want to talk to you about.

276
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,340
Currently the police aren't defying Kira.

277
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,300
All right, I'll listen to what you have to say, but I don't know if I can help you.

278
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,360
Thank you. First, let's meet up and have you listen to what I have to say.

279
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,100
Anywhere you want, just the two of us.

280
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,610
OK then. We'll meet after tonight's news is over.

281
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,010
I understand. I'll get a hotel room.

282
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,780
But is that really OK?

283
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,950
I recall that you live together with Amane.

284
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,450
Things are going well now, aren't they?

285
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,290
No, that's...

286
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,800
She lacks the intelligence to be my partner.

287
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,750
Mochii!

288
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,460
Yes?

289
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,890
Mochii's cooking is good, can do everything, and Misa is living comfortable, but it's been five days already!

290
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,870
Yes.

291
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,560
Let's keep this a secret from Light, even though it makes Misa feel bad.

292
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,340
Yes...

293
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,430
No matter how much Light trusts Misa, this much trust shouldn't be normal.

294
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,640
Light would definitely be jealous!

295
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,410
I heard from Near that this woman could be the second Kira.

296
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,440
But can this airheaded idiot of a woman really be...?

297
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,460
Even now Kira hasn't contacted me.

298
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,460
If Kira wanted to contact me but couldn't, he would use Takada first.

299
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,970
If Kira wanted to contact me but couldn't, he would use Takada first.

300
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,060
Good evening. This is the nine o'clock news.

301
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,060
The words of Kira I am about to speak now, will become the way of life for the world.

302
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:12,490
Besides those who cause harm, those who have ability and live without using it will not be forgiven.

303
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,280
Eh, so he's going to kill lazy people?

304
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,240
That has to be a lie!

305
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,300
You're overdoing it, Mikami.

306
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,620
No, it's too fast for him to make these decisions.

307
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,920
Either way I need to get in contact with him.

308
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,920
How is it, Matsuda?

309
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,010
Sound and video are working properly!

310
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,430
There are no blind spots. The nine o'clock news is over now.

311
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,090
Light-kun, I'm heading back now.

312
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,890
Yes.

313
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,220
I wanted to see you...

314
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,570
That was rude of me. Please, have a seat.

315
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,750
That was rude of me. Please, have a seat.

316
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,180
That was rude of me. Please, have a seat.

317
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,690
Somehow, it doesn't feel like it's been a while since we've met.

318
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,890
What is Light-kun doing!?

319
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,910
Why isn't he saying anything? He needs to hurry or she'll become suspicious.

320
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,090
Ide-san, haven't you ever been in love?

321
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,840
What?

322
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,920
How's it going?

323
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,210
The mood is great!

324
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,840
I wasn't asking about that...

325
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,800
Sorry.

326
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:02,850
Kira!

327
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,190
Is it Mikami?

328
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,120
She said Kira just now!

329
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,070
It can't be... direct contact from Kira?

330
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,370
It'd be better if you answered that.

331
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,940
Yes.

332
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,620
Hello?

333
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,490
No, I'm with my friend. No one else is here.

334
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,780
It was fortunate for the phone to be answered.

335
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,750
Mikami, are you going to rely on luck?

336
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,480
He wanted to see me suddenly.

337
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,000
A person who summoned Kira's spokesperson in private...

338
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,510
Give the phone to that person.

339
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,010
He wants to talk to you.

340
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,220
Choosing you was definitely the right decision.

341
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,420
Light-kun has the phone!

342
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,440
If he's the real thing, it's dangerous!

343
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,890
I'm on the phone now.

344
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,870
Who are you?

345
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,110
November 26th? Five pages? What are you talking about?

346
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,070
November 26th? Five pages? What are you talking about?

347
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,280
November 26th? Five pages? What are you talking about?

348
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,490
God!

349
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,540
Good, Mikami. How much of my situation can you discern?

350
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,500
Is God unable to act freely right now?

351
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,260
Yes.

352
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,070
Are you under surveillance?

353
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes.

354
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,210
Are you really Kira?

355
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,380
He wants me to judge someone!

356
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,760
Look at Sakura TV!

357
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,510
Sakura TV you say?

358
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,260
Sakura TV.

359
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,090
At all costs, to call out Kira!

360
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,130
He died!

361
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,900
This is bad, he's the real thing!

362
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,110
Mikami, you've exceeded my expectations.

363
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,440
Yes.

364
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,090
What? Uninstall all the bugs?

365
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,200
What? Uninstall all the bugs?

366
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,310
We have no choice.

367
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,880
What is the meaning of this?

368
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,730
It should be safe now.

369
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,130
Listen carefully, Kiyomi. I am Kira.

370
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,550
Listen carefully, Kiyomi. I am Kira.

371
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,840
That's right. I am Kira.

372
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,640
That's right. I am Kira.

373
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,550
That's all I wanted to say.

374
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,380
Yagami-kun is... Kira!

375
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,510
Yagami-kun is... Kira!

376
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,740
If you ask Kiyomi about my identity, I will not forgive you.

377
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,940
Yes, as you command, God.

378
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,580
Do you understand?

379
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,030
I'm Kira, and this man is the person with Kira's power.

380
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,740
That's... that's great!

381
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,760
That's... that's great!

382
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,180
You're the only person I ever admired in my life... The only man I had a connection with.

383
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,000
You're the only person I ever admired in my life... The only man I had a connection with.

384
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,040
And you are Kira... this is too wonderful!

385
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,050
And you are Kira... this is too wonderful!

386
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,970
You are going to follow me.

387
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,650
And become the new world's goddess.

388
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,810
Yagami-kun!

389
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,570
Light-kun, are you safe?

390
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,320
Yes, Takada-san was able to smooth things out with Kira.

391
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,840
I'll be acting as her boyfriend, and we can go after Kira like this.

392
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,020
Eliminate.

393
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,100
Eliminate.

394
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,330
Eliminate.

395
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,110
Eliminate.

396
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,330
Eliminate.

397
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,100
Eliminate.

398
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,240
Eliminate.

399
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,240
Eliminate!

400
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

401
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,380
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

402
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,380
This one page of everlasting depression;

403
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,300
hakanai senpou sono meni

404
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,300
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

405
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,570
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

406
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,570
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

407
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,150
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

408
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,150
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

409
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,800
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

410
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,800
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

411
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,650
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

412
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,650
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

413
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,090
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

414
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,090
Who would know of a path to salvation?

415
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,940
Menzai no waarudo

416
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,940
World of acquittal,

417
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,770
seisai no waado

418
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,770
words of retribution!

419
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,510
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

420
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,510
Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

421
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,500
Redeem the game of law!

422
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,500
Aganau houritsu geemu

423
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,530
Despair the Billy,

424
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,530
Zetsubou za birii

425
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,270
iza rinri

426
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,270
here are the morals!

427
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,890
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

428
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,890
Come, relentless eraser rain.

429
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,850
Zetsubou za birii

430
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,850
Despair the Billy,

431
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,560
iza rinri

432
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,560
here are the morals!

433
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,190
Come, relentless eraser rain.

434
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,190
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

435
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,810
tomerarenai eraser rain

436
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,810
relentless eraser rain.

437
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,990
Preview

438
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,110
If I think about it, at that time, I fought L head to head.

439
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,370
Near, that's fine with me!

440
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,790
If you want to fight me directly, I'll do the same.

441
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,000
I accept this challenge!

442
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,200
Next Time

443
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,200
Ridicule
