00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,509
It's been a while.

00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,012
Thank you for taking care
of my father.

24
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,849
S- Sayu... You've grown up...

25
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,058
This is Yagami.

26
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,226
<i>Mr. Deputy Director?</i>

27
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,312
<i>About the trade of the director
for the notebook...</i>

28
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,147
<i>- It's canceled
- What?!</i>

29
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,233
<i>We'll now trade the notebook...
for Sayu Yagami.</i>

30
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,403
<i>At any rate, bring the notebook</i>

31
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,488
<i>to Los Angeles,
by yourself in two days.</i>

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,491
<i>Nice to meet you, L Number Two.</i>

33
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,996
I am the center of SPK...

34
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,708
Let's see, call me... N

35
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,586
<i>N? Is he joking?</i>

36
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:13,508
<i>But what is this... strange feeling?</i>

37
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,012
IMPATIENCE

38
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,223
<i>N... He's similar...</i>

39
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,018
<i>This feeling... is like L...</i>

40
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,354
<i>I said we will
no longer rely on L...</i>

41
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,525
<i>That means,
my orders to the CIA and FBI</i>

42
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,653
<i>will be given priority over L's.</i>

43
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:36,573
<i>However, the murder of
the Director of the NPA</i>

44
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,325
<i>is an unforgivable crime...</i>

45
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,661
I think there is a possibility

46
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,289
that this case could lead
to the arrest of Kira...

47
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,667
So I will lend you my full support.

48
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,379
<i>"Lead to the arrest of Kira?"
Who does he think he is?</i>

49
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,713
<i>This conÔ¨Ådence...</i>

50
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,799
<i>What's wrong, L?</i>

51
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,217
N- Nothing.

52
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,136
Actually, after the director
was murdered...

53
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,389
Deputy Director Yagami's daughter
was kidnapped by someone...

54
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,933
who we believe to be the same person
who killed the director.

55
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,976
They contacted us to make
a deal in Los Angeles.

56
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,063
<i>A deal? In exchange for
the notebook, right?</i>

57
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,981
That's right.

58
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,817
I understand.

59
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,152
I'll gather as many investigators as I can
in Los Angeles

60
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,862
without telling them the details...

61
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,366
And use a satellite to
monitor the L.A. area.

62
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,576
No...

63
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,455
<i>I'll let you have
total authority on this, L.</i>

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,001
Thank goodness.

65
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,628
We make the decisions.

66
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,757
But what was that about the Americans
not trusting L anymore?

67
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,805
Near, are you sure about leaving
this to a fake L

68
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,765
who hasn't succeeded
in catching Kira?

69
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,601
So much the better.

70
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,771
It means that there's a chance
we can take advantage of him.

71
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,399
Of course, peoples' lives
are our first priority.

72
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:56,027
But as the SPK, our goal is... simply...

73
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,614
to get the notebook and capture Kira.

74
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,993
Light...

75
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:10,792
I don't care if it costs me my life.
Please... just save Sayu...

76
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,045
Don't say things like that!

77
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,340
You may be satisfied with that...

78
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,136
but do you know how painful it would be
for everyone you'd leave behind?!

79
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,348
You cannot die in front of Sayu.

80
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,602
You may lose contact with me.

81
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,855
So if you ever come across
a situation where you have to

82
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,273
make a decision by yourself...

83
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:37,068
do whatever you need to do to
make sure that both you and Sayu live.

84
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,446
Promise me that.

85
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,156
Light...

86
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,534
What? No way!

87
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,288
I can really go with you?!

88
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:53,043
Yeah. I may need your eyes
this time.

89
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,755
All right!

90
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,089
Thank you!

91
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,634
I've got to start packing immediately!

92
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,271
I can't decide...

93
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,691
Hey, Light...
Which one do you like?

94
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,543
If things get bad,
I'll have to kill Sayu...

95
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,598
Dad, I'll go on ahead to Los Angeles
and make preparations.

96
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,560
Mr. Ide and the rest of you,
please come after us.

97
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:56,648
We'll take different planes.
So just in case, Mr. Aizawa...

98
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,693
will follow my father and ride
the same plane as him.

99
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,111
All right.

100
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,281
As a disguise,
I'll cut my hair.

101
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,618
Okay everyone, I'm counting on you.

102
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,558
Mr. Yagami.

103
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,685
What is it?
Are you one of the kidnappers?

104
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:38,440
You will take flight SE333.
I have your ticket.

105
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,775
Hurry. It's Gate 18.

106
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,527
All right.

107
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,280
A man has intercepted him at Narita!
Should I arrest him?

108
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,949
Mr. Aizawa, calm down.

109
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,870
It won't do us any good
if you arrest him right now.

110
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,205
Just don't lose sight of him.

111
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,458
Oh, no.

112
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,960
The Deputy Director just got on
a different flight with that man

113
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,253
than the one
he was supposed to catch...

114
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,463
This is an emergency.

115
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,715
<i>- I'm going to get on as a police officer...
- Calm down, Mr. Aizawa!</i>

116
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,968
If you do that and they find out
it will blow everything.

117
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,470
Do you know where it's going?

118
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,722
Umm... Oh...

119
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,474
It's going to Los Angeles too.

120
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,560
<i>Impossible, they even have a plane?</i>

121
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,020
<i>This is bad...</i>

122
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,660
<i>Flight SE333, Flight SE333,
can you hear me?!</i>

123
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,411
<i>You are veering off course!</i>

124
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:38,083
This is Flight SE333,
I hear you loud and clear.

125
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,337
We are not off course.
I changed course.

126
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,964
<i>W- What are you talking about?</i>

127
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,924
<i>What's wrong? Are you joking?</i>

128
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,593
This is not a hijacking.

129
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,722
We're just going to take a little detour
to drop off a passenger.

130
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,767
<i>Feel free to track me by radar.</i>

131
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,603
<i>But if you do anything
to interfere...</i>

132
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,190
I will not hesitate to crash this plane
and take all the passengers with me.

133
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,197
Light... I mean, L.

134
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,740
The plane that
the Deputy Director is on

135
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,200
has veered off course
from Los Angeles.

136
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,619
Someone's going to be
dropped off somewhere...

137
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,037
It's probably the Deputy Director...

138
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,373
<i>Damn it! What's going on?!</i>

139
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,376
<i>I checked the Ô¨Çight crew
ahead of time.</i>

140
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,420
<i>There wasn't anyone suspicious.</i>

141
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,756
<i>The pilot is a veteran of
over Ô¨Åfteen years.</i>

142
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,842
<i>There's no problem with
the co-pilot, either.</i>

143
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,053
<i>So the enemy is powerful enough to
control ordinary people like them.</i>

144
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,890
<i>Damn it. I've got no choice...</i>

145
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,397
<i>Director, this is L. Get me N...</i>

146
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:43,982
Yes.

147
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,235
<i>N, I think you know the situation.</i>

148
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:52,782
<i>Can you notify the airlines, police
and military not to make a move yet?</i>

149
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,327
What is L doing? How unreliable...

150
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,414
All right... L.

151
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,291
We'll figure out where he'll land...

152
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,252
and keep surveillance over
the area by satellite.

153
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,173
If there's anything else we can do,
please let me know.

154
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,761
Take this PDA...

155
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,388
Place the wireless earphone
in your ear.

156
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,647
<i>Yagami, only you can hear my voice.</i>

157
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:26,775
<i>Listen closely.</i>

158
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,446
I'm the one who kidnapped
your daughter.

159
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,118
I have no interest in the lives
of you or your daughter.

160
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,538
Right now,
the only thing I want is...

161
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,957
just the notebook.

162
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,838
<i>If you do as I say,
I won't kill either of you.</i>

163
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,591
<i>I've even arranged
an exchange procedure</i>

164
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,885
<i>that you'll be satisÔ¨Åed with.</i>

165
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,387
<i>Do not Ô¨Åght me.</i>

166
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,016
<i>I am trading the killer notebook
for my daughter's life</i>

167
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,227
<i>with an unknown person...</i>

168
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:08,942
<i>When the time comes,
what do I do?</i>

169
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,949
<i>As a police ofÔ¨Åcer...
as a human being... as a parent...</i>

170
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,905
L, we have pinpointed
where they have landed

171
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,490
with our satellites.

172
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,411
I'll send you footage
of what we're seeing.

173
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,121
<i>Dad!</i>

174
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,040
What's going on?

175
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,501
How is he supposed to make
the exchange there?

176
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,605
<i>You see it, don't you, Yagami?</i>

177
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,190
<i>Enter there.</i>

178
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,691
Underground, huh?

179
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,526
This is interesting...

180
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,616
<i>Damn it. Underground, huh?</i>

181
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,368
<i>That means he predicted that
there'd be satellite surveillance...</i>

182
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,787
<i>Now I can't watch him...</i>

183
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,522
It's bulletproof glass. You understand.

184
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,361
A certain syndicate used this place
up until a few years ago...

185
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,820
to make shady deals.

186
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,198
We've made some modifications.

187
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,659
Slide the notebook through here.

188
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,537
When you slide it in,
I'll release this handle.

189
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,375
We'll step back and
spin the glass door.

190
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,210
The notebook will
be passed this way

191
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,336
and your daughter, to you.

192
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,048
If you don't go through with the trade,
I'll shoot your daughter from here...

193
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,933
<i>L, do you have a plan?</i>

194
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,018
Or do you really think it's all right

195
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:53,189
to let the notebook fall into the
hands of someone you don't know?

196
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,567
Y462, begin.

197
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,237
Now open the notebook
and slide it into...

198
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,073
the slot in the glass door
to the left.

199
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,040
<i>Damn it.
I'm being set back even further...</i>

200
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,627
<i>I've just arrived in L.A.
and I'm not in any situation</i>

201
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,547
<i>to be giving orders to the police
agencies around the world as L...</i>

202
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,508
<i>At this rate... the notebook will...</i>

203
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,635
Light, what's wrong?

204
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,179
Are you all right? You're pale...

205
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,223
Misa, shut up and just do as I say!

206
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,603
I want you to take more care than usual
in killing the criminals in Japan.

207
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,648
He's investigating Kira.

208
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,859
You know something bad
will happen

209
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,485
if the punishing gets delayed,
don't you?

210
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,572
Okay... But who's "he"?

211
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,990
Just do as I say!

212
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,326
You're just taking out
your anger on her.

213
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,126
<i>I- I can still make it...</i>

214
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,505
<i>At this rate,
is my only option to kill Sayu?</i>

215
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,426
All right, I'm going to
test the out notebook.

216
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,928
"Test out?!"
Are you going to kill someone?!

217
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,430
- That's...
- Hey, hey...

218
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,558
We can't trade
without testing it out.

219
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,644
Do you want
your daughter to die?

220
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,909
<i>This is not good!</i>

221
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,870
<i>Only the police
know about this case.</i>

222
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,456
<i>I can't blame
Sayu's death on Kira...</i>

223
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,505
What's wrong?!
Are you all right, Miller?!

224
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,967
That's what you get when you steal and
sell our drugs behind my back.

225
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,303
He was worthless,

226
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,013
but this is the first time
he's been useful.

227
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,225
Y462, the target is dead.

228
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,062
It seems the notebook is real.

229
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,108
Now let go.
We'll exchange it for your daughter.

230
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,660
<i>Sayu... Dad...</i>

231
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,662
Oh, they've been saved.

232
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,206
The perpetrator is headed
for a helicopter.

233
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,292
We can assume that
that's his means of escape.

234
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,672
This means that the notebook
was definitely exchanged.

235
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,262
We still don't know
what may happen next.

236
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,558
Follow their helicopter the best
you can until it lands.

237
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,852
<i>Don't let it out of
your satellite's view...</i>

238
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,522
You sure give difficult orders easily.

239
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,150
All right. I'll try my best...

240
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,029
<i>We can't. We've been tricked, L.</i>

241
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,545
<i>A missile?!</i>

242
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,882
That's a type that
can't be tracked by radar.

243
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,384
<i>The notebook is on a missile?</i>

244
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,019
The missile's been launched!

245
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,772
<i>The helicopter or the missile?
Which one is the notebook on?</i>

246
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,195
Boss, I'm sure you were watching.

247
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,655
I did everything as
you told me perfectly.

248
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,742
Yeah, good job.

249
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,953
<i>So now my past mistakes
will be wiped clean, right?</i>

250
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,748
Yeah, I'll wipe them clean...

251
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,583
Do it!

252
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,507
Near, the helicopter has...

253
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:48,966
I thought so...

254
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,969
This means that the notebook
was definitely on the missile!

255
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,013
The missile can't be tracked!

256
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,391
I've completely lost sight
of the target...

257
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,239
<i>It won't be difÔ¨Åcult
to retrieve the missile</i>

258
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,324
<i>if it falls in
an unpopulated area.</i>

259
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,786
He should be getting his hands on
the notebook right about now...

260
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,333
<i>When he does, I have a good idea
of what he'll do Ô¨Årst.</i>

261
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,275
<i>L.</i>

262
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,572
Yes?

263
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,199
<i>They got us.</i>

264
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,867
"Got" You?

265
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,077
<i>Yes.</i>

266
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:25,706
Most of the members of the SPK
have been killed.

267
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:34,256
L... You helplessly handed over
the notebook.

268
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,135
N... Are you saying that if
you were in command

269
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,929
that you wouldn't have
handed it over?

270
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:45,434
No, with that kind of preparation,
it would have been taken either way.

271
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,479
There's no point in us quarreling.

272
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,150
<i>Let's help each other and
tell each other what we know.</i>

273
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,947
I have some idea of who
the culprit may be.

274
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:04,870
<i>I think a person who goes by
the name Mello is behind this.</i>

275
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,081
<i>The name... Mello...?</i>

276
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,127
I don't have his photograph and
I don't know his real name.

277
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:15,548
I only know that until four years ago
he was at an orphanage...

278
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,968
called Wammy's House
in Winchester, England...

279
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,970
<i>Wammy's House?</i>

280
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,347
<i>That was the institution
Watari established...</i>

281
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:27,268
I think that Mello is playing
a game with me.

282
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,355
To see who can catch the last boss,
Kira, the fastest...

283
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,077
Armo Justin...

284
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,622
It's Armonia Justin.

285
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:54,211
I went to the old man, the king,
to report that I lost my notebook,

286
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,921
but when I described
what it looked like...

287
00:20:56,005 --> 00:21:01,177
he said that Ryuk said it was his and
that he dropped it, and took it...

288
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,181
What should I do in this case?

289
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,351
In this case, you've got to
get it back from Ryuk.

290
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,854
I thought so...

291
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:16,442
So I have to...
go the Human world, huh?

292
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,779
Yeah, seems like you have to go...

293
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,530
I see...

294
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:26,118
