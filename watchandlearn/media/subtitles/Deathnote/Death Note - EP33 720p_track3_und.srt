WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

92
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,150
The second L, as well as the one I suspect to be Kira, is... Yagami Light.

93
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,390
The second L, as well as the one I suspect to be Kira, is... Yagami Light.

94
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,850
Good evening. This is Takada Kiyomi.

95
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,690
Messages from Kira will now be transmitted as the law to the new world.

96
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,160
I think we can use Takada Kiyomi in this investigation.

97
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,070
I'm sorry.

98
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,080
Kira?

99
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,830
Remove all bugs?

100
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,540
We have no choice...

101
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,190
Listen, Kiyomi.

102
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,250
I am Kira.

103
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,280
Yagami-kun is... Kira?

104
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,050
Yagami-kun is... Kira?

105
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,010
Ridicule

106
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,080
All the pieces are now in place.

107
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,530
At this stage, I should go to Japan.

108
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,850
At this stage, I should go to Japan.

109
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,100
Chief Lester.

110
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,230
Yes.

111
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,290
Can you come back to New York one more time?

112
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,140
One more time?

113
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,990
I am going to Japan as well.

114
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,450
So I will support you from New York?

115
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,770
No.

116
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,080
Then, why do you want me back in New York?

117
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,120
I have never boarded a plane alone in my life.

118
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,110
I want you to escort me to Japan.

119
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,090
Understood.

120
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,600
As I thought. We managed to get into Yoshida Productions and NHN.

121
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,640
Misa-Misa's infiltration was a huge success!

122
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,500
At this moment, getting into NHN is difficult.

123
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,670
But with this, they won't suspect a thing.

124
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,720
Yeah.

125
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,070
As her manager, Mogi-san will be able to get in as well.

126
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,570
We definitely want someone to be able to go in and out freely.

127
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,040
Of course, I'll be watching Takada.

128
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,560
This is Near. Let me speak to L.

129
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,290
This is Near. Let me speak to L.

130
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,320
This is L. What is it?

131
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,620
This is L. What is it?

132
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,850
In order to capture Kira, I have come to Japan.

133
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,550
In order to capture Kira, I have come to Japan.

134
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,570
Japan? Why did he tell me that?

135
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,050
Japan? Why did he tell me that?

136
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,920
L. You should be watching Takada-san to aid your investigation on Kira, right?

137
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,390
L. You should be watching Takada-san to aid your investigation on Kira, right?

138
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,180
Yes. I am currently in contact with her.

139
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,810
Yes. I am currently in contact with her.

140
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,920
I see.

141
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,150
If you want to catch Kira, keeping an eye on NHN and Takada Kiyomi is common sense.

142
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:50,450
Well, please inform Takada that some members from the SPK has come to Japan to capture Kira.

143
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,500
What for?

144
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,250
It's bait for Kira.

145
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,860
Also, I would like her to know this as well;

146
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,510
The SPK has only four members, myself included.

147
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,220
Kira will not run away.

148
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,430
He will certainly try to kill us.

149
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,980
Then, we will get him instead.

150
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,060
"Get him instead", you say?

151
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,140
That's fine, Near!

152
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,900
I accept your challenge!

153
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,160
I am in Japan.

154
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,700
I am in Japan as well.

155
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,280
Then we are pretty close to each other. We could even meet.

156
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,290
Then we are pretty close to each other. We could even meet.

157
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,910
That's right.

158
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,550
When the time comes, I'll count on you.

159
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,800
Alright.

160
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,970
That will be the time we settle this Kira matter.

161
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,730
Definitely.

162
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,920
Come to think of it, since that time, this has been a one-on-one fight with L.

163
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,000
Instead of going against L, I am going against L's successors.

164
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,110
That's fine, Near.

165
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,390
If you're going for it, I am going for it as well.

166
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,760
When we meet, we'll see who is better...

167
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,460
Who is at the higher position...

168
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,780
When the time comes, this fight will come to an end...

169
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,960
And I will stand on top.

170
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,420
First, let's revise what we have so far.

171
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,800
L is Yagami Light.

172
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,620
And he is Kira. We'll call him L-Kira for short.

173
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,930
And he is Kira. We'll call him L-Kira for short.

174
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,580
Then the other, the one who is holding the notebook, and doing the killing, X-Kira.

175
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,410
Then the other, the one who is holding the notebook, and doing the killing, X-Kira.

176
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,520
Then the other, the one who is holding the notebook, and doing the killing, X-Kira.

177
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,760
X-Kira is doing the judgments, and definitely has the eyes of a Shinigami.

178
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,570
X-Kira is doing the judgments, and definitely has the eyes of a Shinigami.

179
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,950
Then, L-Kira and X-Kira are using Takada as a bridge to communicate.

180
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,500
As for the actual method to beat Kira, there are two ways.

181
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,210
As for the actual method to beat Kira, there are two ways.

182
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,740
The first way will be to... kill both L-Kira and X-Kira, and take the notebook.

183
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,420
The first way will be to... kill both L-Kira and X-Kira, and take the notebook.

184
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,180
However, we will never do something like that.

185
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,340
However, we will never do something like that.

186
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,690
Why is that?

187
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,490
That's not the way we work.

188
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,890
"We?"

189
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,540
That's right.

190
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,620
Killing someone to see if the judgments will stop.

191
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,780
That kind of trial and error is not L's, nor my style.

192
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,900
L would not accept that.

193
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,010
It would be meaningless as the successor to L.

194
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,800
Takada-san, I heard on the news that you're receiving countless fan letters daily.

195
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,680
That's right. It seems there are at least 200 of them each day.

196
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,850
200 of them? I'm getting jealous...

197
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,490
Don't.

198
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,400
Just listening to them without any pictures is pretty boring.

199
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,320
I think fan letters are something you should just skip through.

200
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,900
That's right.

201
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:19,460
Read the messages from now on in a calm manner so that people listening to this won't notice anything.

202
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,090
With the SPK on the move, right now, for your own safety,

203
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,170
With the SPK on the move, right now, for your own safety,

204
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,150
instead of just waiting for his messages, you should go and tell him about your condition.

205
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,840
instead of just waiting for his messages, you should go and tell him about your condition.

206
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,220
Light is making his move right now!

207
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,480
You should not be just the spokesperson for Kira.

208
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,810
Why don't you try to call out Kira from your side?

209
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,110
T has other missions: creating a perfect world.

210
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,910
T has other missions: creating a perfect world.

211
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,410
I would like to have you carrying out the judgment of Kira.

212
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,570
It's okay.

213
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,920
It's you, so I'm sure you can do it well.

214
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,590
By doing that, information that you don't want the SPK to know can be passed on to Kira.

215
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,960
I got it.

216
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,020
I will do it.

217
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,060
He did it!

218
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,020
That's Light-kun for you! He's really good!

219
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,130
Eliminate. Eliminate. Eliminate.

220
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,390
Eliminate. Eliminate. Eliminate.

221
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,270
Eliminate. Eliminate. Eliminate.

222
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,980
Takada Kiyomi?

223
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,410
Yes?

224
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,940
I have a message for you.

225
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,310
Please send a fan letter than only I will recognize.

226
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,700
In it, include five pages from the notebook.

227
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,340
In it, include five pages from the notebook.

228
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,680
Until I receive it, carry on with your judgments.

229
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,350
And after I send it to you?

230
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,530
You will not use the real notebook, but carry out your judgments with a fake one.

231
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,380
You will not use the real notebook, but carry out your judgments with a fake one.

232
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,580
Fake?

233
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,230
Yes.

234
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,220
Make a fake one that looks like the real one.

235
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,150
And use that for your judgments.

236
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,010
I received the order.

237
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,360
God... what are you thinking?

238
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,950
God... what are you thinking?

239
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,060
No, there is no need for me to think about that.

240
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,250
God is absolute.

241
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,000
I will just carry out God's will.

242
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,470
What's with this program?

243
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,790
This is the program that replaced "Kira's Realm".

244
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,780
Coming up with something like this is just like them.

245
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:05,250
In Today's Miss Takada, we will introduce the four bodyguards of Takada.

246
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,710
The winner of the 22nd World Female Karate Championships, Oyama Tatsumi.

247
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,090
Former CIA investigator, Hal Lidner.

248
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,490
If there is a SPK member among them, this Hal Lidner...

249
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,400
Looks like Near didn't make any effort to hide it.

250
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,610
In the Shinjuku business district, six people...

251
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,770
If I were to choose X-Kira, who would I choose?

252
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:42,910
Kira's existence, as well as Kira's teachings, are to be considered good, and should be infused into the minds of children.

253
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,900
Takada was chosen because she is a supporter of Kira.

254
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,190
X-Kira must have known that she is a supporter of Kira. A person that has a certain relationship with Takada.

255
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,030
X-Kira must have known that she is a supporter of Kira. A person that has a certain relationship with Takada.

256
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,390
Kira will not allow any criminal acts, no matter how small they are.

257
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,270
From now on, targets for his judgments will include all the humans in the world.

258
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,940
I definitely want to hear Kira's voice and thoughts one more time.

259
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:31,660
I think that Kira's teaching is the straightest path to world peace.

260
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:40,710
Young people with talent should not be allowed to waste them. They should use their talents to improve society.

261
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:52,030
If we don't have instructions or directions from Kira, I think it's necessary for us to make our own judgments based on Kira's way.

262
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,940
L-Kira is Yagami Light. Could X-Kira be Mikami Teru?

263
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,100
L-Kira is Yagami Light. Could X-Kira be Mikami Teru?

264
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,220
Takada Kiyomi...

265
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,870
Everything is making sense now.

266
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,760
That's why I ask, why am I not the main attraction?

267
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,490
I thought they said I'm the highlight of this year?

268
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,760
Well, highlight is highlight. The main attraction is something different.

269
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,600
That's why, you have to be more careful.

270
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,440
Takada Kiyomi!

271
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,440
What an idiot. She doesn't know she's just being used by Light in his investigation.

272
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,740
Stop that! If you go on, you might get killed!

273
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,200
I know that. That's why I am saying this softly.

274
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,690
Ah! She smirked at me! Misa is going to break her legs!

275
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,910
Ah! She smirked at me! Misa is going to break her legs!

276
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,660
Ah! She smirked at me! Misa is going to break her legs!

277
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,310
Ah! Don't!

278
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,970
Ah! Don't!

279
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,530
What are you trying to do?

280
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,050
"What?"... I was just going to ask the same.

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,930
Lidner. She is my important friend.

282
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,440
Please don't be too hard on her.

283
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,280
Yes, Takada-sama. I'm sorry about that.

284
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,780
Mi... Misa-Misa! Are you okay?

285
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,740
Mi... Misa-Misa! Are you okay?

286
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,930
Mi... Misa-Misa! Are you okay?

287
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,580
This is so humiliating!

288
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,620
L, if mister Aizawa is there, is it possible for me to speak to him?

289
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,730
L, if mister Aizawa is there, is it possible for me to speak to him?

290
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,420
L, if mister Aizawa is there, is it possible for me to speak to him?

291
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,730
Near, this is Aizawa. What is it?

292
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,460
Near, this is Aizawa. What is it?

293
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,910
When L meets Takada, are there cameras and bugs used to record their conversation?

294
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,470
When L meets Takada, are there cameras and bugs used to record their conversation?

295
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,510
No... right now, only bugs.

296
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,430
No... right now, only bugs.

297
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,840
I see. Right now, only bugs.

298
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,630
I see. Right now, only bugs.

299
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,980
Thank you very much.

300
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:05,490
If they only use bugs, it's possible that X-Kira and L-Kira are communicating through Takada.

301
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,570
That means, Lidner is in a pretty dangerous situation.

302
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:16,370
To put things bluntly, the most important thing right now is to let L focus on Takada and Lidner.

303
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,040
And we have to use this chance to get Mikami.

304
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,790
How is it, Gevanni?

305
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,510
Mikami, right?

306
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,670
Well... it's amazingly simple to trail him.

307
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,200
He's not hiding or anything, and he has lived in the same room for four years.

308
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,680
And he seems to be leading a normal life.

309
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,150
He's doing his prosecution job normally as well.

310
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,690
I don't think he is X-Kira...

311
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,300
No, there is an extremely high possibility that Mikami is X-Kira.

312
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,690
Please pay more attention.

313
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,690
Watch him carefully until he goes back to his room.

314
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,700
Yes.

315
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,390
Really... don't make me do this again and again, NHN...

316
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,450
And I was only told "Please pay attention to what you say" again and again...

317
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,320
What is this?

318
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,380
Yes, I will ask her now.

319
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,220
Misa-Misa, Takada wanted to have dinner with you and talk girl-to-girl.

320
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,510
That Kiyomi... what is she...

321
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:22,880
Won't that be great? The show's host and highlight having dinner together.

322
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,360
Tell her I'm okay with it.

323
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,360
Hello.

324
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,800
Takada-sama, the dinner is confirmed.

325
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,070
Well, that's something I'm looking forward to.

326
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:40,200
Lidner, make sure we get a respectable room, and sit in with us for the dinner.

327
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,260
Yes.

328
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,400
Amane-san. Sorry for making you come at this late hour.

329
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,200
I can't really leave until I'm done with News 9.

330
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,780
Not at all. Misa is actually quite fine with this.

331
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,570
Well, what is it?

332
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,500
"What?"? I really don't know how to answer your sudden question.

333
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,380
He seems to be very busy these days. Do you manage to see him nowadays?

334
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,480
Of course I'm seeing him. He's still just like a boy in front of me.

335
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,930
What a woman!

336
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:50,490
Every night when he comes home, he's very sticky to me. It's very troublesome.

337
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,550
I see. So you are getting along well.

338
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,280
That's great.

339
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,790
Well, I would like to let you know something in advance.

340
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,160
I'm going to announce my engagement with him at the New Year Show.

341
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,880
Does he know about this?

342
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:16,180
Of course! You can't possibly get engaged with just one person consenting.

343
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,430
It's been a month since we agreed on that.

344
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,020
Will it be okay for me to announce that in the show, host?

345
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,740
I see.

346
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,860
If it can be done that is.

347
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,530
What do you mean by that?

348
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,240
Are you going to use your authority as the host to stop me?

349
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,810
Or could you possibly... try to get Kira to kill me?

350
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,960
Or could you possibly... try to get Kira to kill me?

351
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,730
No way. Kira decides who he wants to judge.

352
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,420
No way. Kira decides who he wants to judge.

353
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,130
It has nothing to do with me.

354
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,990
I see you as a friend. Please don't say something as cold as that.

355
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,520
I see you as a friend. Please don't say something as cold as that.

356
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,520
And no matter how bad a person it is, I don't kill people.

357
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:13,440
Well, fine. Although I like Kira, he's soon going to be caught by Light.

358
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,200
If he's caught, you'll get your share too.

359
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,240
You will definitely be... put to death.

360
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,120
You will definitely be... put to death.

361
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,840
Takada-sama! Are you okay?

362
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,360
Takada-sama! Are you okay?

363
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,600
Listen, Kiyomi.

364
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,010
I am Kira.

365
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,270
And you will be with me, as the goddess of the new world.

366
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,380
Amane-san.

367
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,110
Yes.

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,200
I am not happy.

369
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,160
Eh? Neither am I!

370
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:10,150
Looks like we can have dinner when you are a bit older and have more manners.

371
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,600
Look here, I'm older than you, Kiyomi-chan.

372
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,660
And to leave a table before the dinner ends, that's even worse manners, right?

373
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,400
Mochii!

374
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,700
Sorry to keep you waiting! How are you?

375
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,830
Are you okay?

376
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,900
Of course! I won!

377
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,740
Won?

378
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,310
It was an easy victory!

379
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,950
In tonight's meeting between Takada and Amane, their conversation was about "him".

380
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,500
In other words, who is the real girlfriend of Yagami Light.

381
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,550
Near.

382
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,510
From this, what I can say is...

383
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:11,520
Yagami Light has Takada and Amane in a love triangle.

384
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,860
Near, please be more serious.

385
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,150
I am not trying to make light of this situation.

386
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,850
It will not be easy for him to betray either.

387
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,990
No, they will follow him with their lives.

388
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,710
Please stop that!

389
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:41,000
What is it, girl? You are inviting me to do that by wearing such short skirts, right?

390
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,770
Someone...

391
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,950
Cell phone?

392
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,000
Mikami took out a notebook!

393
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,160
Eliminate.

394
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,850
He's writing something on it. Could it be...?

395
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,430
He's writing something on it. Could it be...?

396
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,780
Mikami is getting off the train.

397
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

398
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,390
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

399
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,390
This one page of everlasting depression;

400
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,310
hakanai senpou sono meni

401
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,310
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

402
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,580
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

403
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,580
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

404
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,160
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

405
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,160
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

406
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,810
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

407
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,810
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

408
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,660
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

409
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,660
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

410
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,100
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

411
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,100
Who would know of a path to salvation?

412
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,950
Menzai no waarudo

413
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,950
World of acquittal,

414
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,780
seisai no waado

415
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,780
words of retribution!

416
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,520
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

417
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,520
Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

418
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,510
Redeem the game of law!

419
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,510
Aganau houritsu geemu

420
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,540
Despair the Billy,

421
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,540
Zetsubou za birii

422
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,280
here are the morals!

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,900
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

425
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,900
Come, relentless eraser rain.

426
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,860
Zetsubou za birii

427
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,860
Despair the Billy,

428
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,570
iza rinri

429
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,570
here are the morals!

430
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,200
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

431
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,200
Come, relentless eraser rain.

432
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,820
tomerarenai eraser rain

433
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,820
relentless eraser rain.

434
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,990
Preview

435
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,270
Mikami is speaking to himself. He's doing something with the trash paper at his feet.

436
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,830
Mikami is speaking to himself. He's doing something with the trash paper at his feet.

437
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,830
Now, he went inside the gym.

438
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,410
I'll get inside the locker room.

439
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,780
Key to the briefcase... I'm opening it.

440
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,540
Key to the briefcase... I'm opening it.

441
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,630
I got the note.

442
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,890
Next Time

443
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,890
Vigilance
