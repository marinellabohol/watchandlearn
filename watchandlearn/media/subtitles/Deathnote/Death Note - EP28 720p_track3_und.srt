WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,020
I haven't seen you in a while.

93
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,190
I'm indebted to you for always taking care of my dad.

94
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:29,960
S-Sayu-chan... Wow, you've really grown up...

S-Sayu-chan... Wow, you've really grown up...

S-Sayu-chan... Wow, you've really grown up...

97
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,270
This is Yagami.

Deputy Chief... regarding the deal to exchange the Chief for the notebook...

99
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,490
Deputy Chief... regarding the deal to exchange the Chief for the notebook...

100
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,680
That's now off.

101
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,280
What?!

102
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Instead, we'll now exchange the notebook in return for Yagami Sayu.

103
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,500
Alone. With the notebook. Within two days. In LA.

104
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,550
Alone. With the notebook. Within two days. In LA.

105
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,760
Alone. With the notebook. Within two days. In LA.

106
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,710
Alone. With the notebook. Within two days. In LA.

107
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,910
Second-generation L... it's a pleasure to meet you.

108
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,790
Second-generation L... it's a pleasure to meet you.

109
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,180
I am the one at the center of the SPK.

110
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,190
Let me see... I'm N.

111
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,880
Let me see... I'm N.

112
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,570
"N"? Is this a joke?

113
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,050
"N"? Is this a joke?

114
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,770
And yet... this feeling... What is it?

115
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,500
And yet... this feeling... What is it?

116
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,640
And yet... this feeling... What is it?

117
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,020
Impatience

118
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,500
N... this feeling... it's similar... to L.

119
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,830
N... this feeling... it's similar... to L.

120
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,400
N... this feeling... it's similar... to L.

121
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,560
N... this feeling... it's similar... to L.

122
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,680
I know we said we wouldn't be depending on L, and in reality, within America,

123
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,080
the CIA and FBI are already operating under my command, not L's.

124
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,460
However, the murder of the Chief of the Japanese Police Force is an unforgivable crime,

125
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:40,930
and I believe this case will potentially lead to the capture of Kira. Thus, we'd like to offer you our full cooperation.

126
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,300
"Lead to the capture of Kira"? What's with this guy?

127
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,720
"Lead to the capture of Kira"? What's with this guy?

128
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,930
This confidence...

129
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,600
Something wrong, L?

130
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,520
No...

131
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:57,270
The truth is that after the Chief was murdered, the people believed to be responsible abducted Deputy Chief Yagami's daughter.

132
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,190
They've demanded that we go to LA in order to make the exchange.

133
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,650
Exchange? For the notebook I presume?

134
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,350
Exchange? For the notebook I presume?

135
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,030
Yes.

136
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,640
Alright. We'll gather as many agents as possible in LA without divulging too many details about the case,

137
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,630
and monitor the whole of LA with satellite cameras...

138
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,560
No.

139
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,100
Actually, I'll leave the command of this operation to you, L.

140
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,270
That's good. At least we're in charge.

141
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,890
But to say that America will no longer count on L...

142
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,800
Near, you're really fine with this? Leaving it in the hands of that fake L, who hasn't even been able to pursue Kira properly...

143
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,130
Near, you're really fine with this? Leaving it in the hands of that fake L, who hasn't even been able to pursue Kira properly...

144
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,030
Near, you're really fine with this? Leaving it in the hands of that fake L, who hasn't even been able to pursue Kira properly...

145
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,540
That's precisely why it's fine.

146
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,030
It means that there'll be gaps for us to take advantage of.

147
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,680
Of course, protecting human life is our first priority.

148
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,670
However, the SPK's main goals are ultimately to recover the notebook and capture Kira.

149
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,060
Light...

150
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,310
Even if you have to sacrifice my life... whatever happens... save Sayu.

151
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,260
Even if you have to sacrifice my life... whatever happens... save Sayu.

152
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,220
Even if you have to sacrifice my life... whatever happens... save Sayu.

153
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,970
Don't say such stupid things!

154
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,560
That might be fine with you, but do you realize how much the people you leave behind will suffer?!

155
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,570
I can't let you die in front of Sayu.

156
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,430
It's possible that at some point you'll lose contact with me.

157
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,770
If you find yourself in a situation where you have to make the decisions on your own,

158
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,080
you'll choose the option where neither you nor Sayu needs to die. Promise me this.

159
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,140
you'll choose the option where neither you nor Sayu needs to die. Promise me this.

160
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,680
Light...

161
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,540
What?! No way?!

162
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,260
I can really go with you?!

163
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,260
Yeah. Your eyes might be needed again.

164
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,560
Yay! Thank you!

165
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,020
I'll pack my luggage straight away!

166
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,790
Hmm, I can't decide...

167
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,040
Hey Light, which one looks good?

168
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,860
If it comes down to it, I'll have no choice but to kill Sayu...

169
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,930
If it comes down to it, I'll have no choice but to kill Sayu...

170
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,280
Father, I'll head to LA first and complete all the arrangements.

171
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,780
Ide-san and the rest can follow.

172
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,060
However, you should all take separate flights from each other,

173
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,950
and as an added precaution, Aizawa-san will tail my father and board the same plane.

174
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,120
Got it.

175
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,470
I'll cut my hair to disguise myself.

176
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,130
I'm counting on you all.

177
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,850
Mr. Yagami.

178
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,950
What is it? Are you part of the gang responsible for this?

179
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,850
Board flight SE333. I have your ticket.

180
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,930
Hurry, it's gate 18.

181
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,580
Okay...

182
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,500
A man has made contact at Narita. Should I apprehend him?

183
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:46,330
Aizawa-san, calm down. Apprehending him here and now will achieve nothing.

184
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,930
Just ensure you don't lose sight of them.

185
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,970
Damn it! The Chief and that man are boarding a different flight from the one we're supposed to be taking...

186
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,260
Damn it! The Chief and that man are boarding a different flight from the one we're supposed to be taking...

187
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,770
Since it's an emergency I can try and board it as a police offi--

188
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,770
Calm down, Aizawa-san!

189
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,390
We can't risk doing something that might get us found out.

190
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,770
Do you know the flight's destination?

191
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,780
It's bound for LA too...

192
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,850
I can't believe this, they even switched planes... this is bad...

193
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,360
I can't believe this, they even switched planes... this is bad...

194
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,330
Flight SE333, Flight SE333, do you read me? You are straying off your flight path!

195
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,120
Flight SE333, Flight SE333, do you read me? You are straying off your flight path!

196
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,200
Flight SE333, Flight SE333, do you read me? You are straying off your flight path!

197
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,800
Flight SE333, Flight SE333, do you read me? You are straying off your flight path!

198
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,380
This is Flight SE333 reading you loud and clear.

199
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,990
We're not straying off our flight path, I'm purposely heading this way.

200
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,410
What are you saying?! What's wrong with you?! Is this some kind of joke?

201
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,170
What are you saying?! What's wrong with you?! Is this some kind of joke?

202
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,230
What are you saying?! What's wrong with you?! Is this some kind of joke?

203
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,020
This is not a hi-jacking. I'm just making a small detour so that we can drop off one of the passengers.

204
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,880
Feel free to follow our progress on the radar.

205
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:56,490
However, should any attempt to interfere be made, I won't hesitate to crash this plane, taking all the passengers with me.

206
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,510
Light-kun.... I mean L, instead of going to LA, the Deputy Chief's plane is now heading in a different direction.

207
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,450
Light-kun.... I mean L, instead of going to LA, the Deputy Chief's plane is now heading in a different direction.

208
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,250
Light-kun.... I mean L, instead of going to LA, the Deputy Chief's plane is now heading in a different direction.

209
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,300
When they mentioned dropping someone off, they probably meant the Deputy Chief...

210
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,860
Damn it! What the hell is going on?!

211
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,180
I checked the entire flight crew for today, and never found anyone remotely suspicious!

212
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,170
The captain is a veteran of over 15 years... there's nothing suspicious about the co-pilot either...

213
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,100
The captain is a veteran of over 15 years... there's nothing suspicious about the co-pilot either...

214
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,480
Do they really have the power to control people like this?

215
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,040
Shit... I don't have a choice...

216
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,150
Shit... I don't have a choice...

217
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,810
Chief? This is L. Let me speak to N.

218
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,750
Chief? This is L. Let me speak to N.

219
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,400
Chief? This is L. Let me speak to N.

220
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,990
Yes...

221
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,380
N, I'm sure you're aware of the situation.

222
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,600
N, I'm sure you're aware of the situation.

223
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,000
Can I ask you to instruct the airline company, police and military to take no action?

224
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,370
What does L think they're doing?! They're so unreliable...

225
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,040
What does L think they're doing?! They're so unreliable...

226
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,740
Understood, L. Once we've determined the landing point, we'll monitor the area via satellite.

227
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,340
Understood, L. Once we've determined the landing point, we'll monitor the area via satellite.

228
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,680
Understood, L. Once we've determined the landing point, we'll monitor the area via satellite.

229
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,470
If there's anything else we can assist you with, just let us know.

230
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,920
Take this computer terminal.

231
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,400
Put the wireless earpiece on.

232
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,070
Yagami, you're the only one who can hear my voice.

233
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,790
Listen carefully.

234
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,710
I'm the main culprit responsible for kidnapping your daughter.

235
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,830
I'm not even remotely interested in taking your, or your daughter's life.

236
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,350
Right now, the only thing I want is the notebook.

237
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,180
If you do exactly as I tell you, I won't kill either of you.

238
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,030
I've prepared a method of exchange that I think you'll find acceptable, and will be able to follow without qualm.

239
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,520
Just don't attempt to oppose me.

240
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,400
Exchanging my daughter's life for the notebook... with someone whose identity remains unknown...

241
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,490
When the pressure's on... which should I take?

242
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,010
When the pressure's on... which should I take?

243
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,390
As a police officer... as a human being... as a parent...

244
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,790
As a police officer... as a human being... as a parent...

245
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,360
As a police officer... as a human being... as a parent...

246
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,900
L, we have the landing area on satellite.

247
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,500
We'll rely all images we see directly to you.

248
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,330
Father...

249
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,370
What's going on? How are they planning to make the exchange in a place like this?

250
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,760
What's going on? How are they planning to make the exchange in a place like this?

251
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,840
See that, Yagami? Enter through there.

252
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,120
See that, Yagami? Enter through there.

253
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,610
Underground, huh?

254
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,570
This is getting interesting...

255
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,870
Damn, they're underground...

256
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,590
Of course, they must have figure that we'd use satellite.

257
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,110
Now we can't even monitor their movements...

258
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,450
This is bullet-proof glass. Understand?

259
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,250
This is bullet-proof glass. Understand?

260
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,460
Up until a few years ago, this place was used as a trading area for certain organizations... since then it's been altered slightly.

261
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,330
Up until a few years ago, this place was used as a trading area for certain organizations... since then it's been altered slightly.

262
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,340
Put the notebook in here. When that's done, I'll release this lock.

263
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,360
Put the notebook in here. When that's done, I'll release this lock.

264
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,240
Then, we'll both take a step back and rotate the glass. Notebook comes this way, girl goes that way.

265
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,390
Then, we'll both take a step back and rotate the glass. Notebook comes this way, girl goes that way.

266
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,310
If you fail to cooperate with the exchange, I'll shoot her.

267
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,860
L, what's your plan?

268
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:47,490
Don't tell me you think it's okay for the notebook to fall into the hands of someone you can't identify?

269
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,510
Y462, begin.

270
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,180
Alright, hand the notebook over. Open it up and pass it through the glass on the left.

271
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,680
Alright, hand the notebook over. Open it up and pass it through the glass on the left.

272
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,790
Damn it! I've got no choice in this matter...

273
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,680
I've only just arrived in LA and I'm in no position to maneuver the world's police and military as L.

274
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,640
At this rate the notebook will...

275
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,000
Light, what's up? Are you okay? You look a bit pale...

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,360
Light, what's up? Are you okay? You look a bit pale...

277
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,320
Light, what's up? Are you okay? You look a bit pale...

278
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,070
Just shut up and do as you're told!

279
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,500
I mean, I need you to continue judging the criminals in Japan as normal.

280
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:33,640
They're closing in on us. You should realize how important it is not to neglect this now.

281
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,370
Erm... okay, but who are "they"--

282
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,020
Look, just do as you're told!

283
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,770
He's just taking it out on you.

284
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,700
There's still time... now that it comes to this, have I no choice but to kill Sayu?

285
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,470
There's still time... now that it comes to this, have I no choice but to kill Sayu?

286
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,270
Very well, let's test the notebook

287
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,810
"Test"?! You're going to kill someone--

288
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,720
We can't perform the exchange without testing it first.

289
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,620
You want your daughter to die?

290
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,480
I can't...

291
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,100
Only people from the police know about this incident... I wouldn't be able to lay the blame for Sayu's death on Kira...

292
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,630
Only people from the police know about this incident... I wouldn't be able to lay the blame for Sayu's death on Kira...

293
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,530
What's going on?

294
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,470
Are you alright, Miller?

295
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,980
This is what happens when you try and make money from drugs that belong to the mafia.

296
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,700
He's finally been of some use to us.

297
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,150
Y462, the target is dead.

298
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,020
Looks like the notebook is the real deal.

299
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,700
In that case, let go of it. We'll exchange it for the girl.

300
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,200
In that case, let go of it. We'll exchange it for the girl.

301
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,670
Sayu... Father...

302
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,730
Sayu... Father...

303
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,840
Oh, so they're okay then.

304
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,470
The culprits are getting into a helicopter. I guess that's their escape route.

305
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,390
So this makes it 100% certain that the exchange has gone through.

306
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,360
But we don't know what they intend to do from here...

307
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:29,940
We'll follow their helicopter as far as we can via satellite, and try not to lose them.

308
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:36,290
Easier said than done, but fine... We'll try our best.

309
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,000
It's no good. They've got us, L.

310
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,230
A missile?!

311
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,230
That type of missile is untraceable by radar.

312
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,560
The notebook's on a missile?!

313
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,150
The missile has been launched!

314
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,950
The helicopter or the missile?! Where's the notebook?!

315
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,760
Boss, I'm sure you're watching, but it's all gone according to plan!

316
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,800
Yeah, well done.

317
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,960
This will wipe out all my past failures, right?

318
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,860
Yeah, it'll all be wiped out...

319
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,340
Do it.

320
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,580
Near! The helicopter!

321
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,770
I thought as much.

322
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,110
This must mean the notebook is on the missile!

323
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,980
We have no idea where the missile is heading!

324
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,340
We've completely lost sight of it...

325
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:49,170
If they bring the missile down in an uninhabited area, it wouldn't be too hard to recover...

326
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,650
They've probably got a hold of the notebook by now.

327
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,030
If they have, then what's the first thing they'll do?

328
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,270
No, that's already obvious...

329
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,290
L...

330
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,460
Yes?

331
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,570
They got us.

332
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,940
"They got us"?

333
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,880
Yes.

334
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,720
They majority of the SPK members have been killed.

335
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:28,040
L, your team handed over the notebook without any attempt to stop it.

336
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,900
N. Do you mean that you could have prevented this under your command?

337
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,530
No, given the amount of preparation put in, no matter who was in charge, they would have gotten away with it.

338
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,550
But there's little point in bickering about that now.

339
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,450
We need to share our information and cooperate.

340
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:52,080
It's not as if I have absolutely no idea who's behind this.

341
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:59,030
The person I believe to be behind this goes by the name of "Mello".

342
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,090
Goes by the name of "Mello"?!

343
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,640
I don't have any photos of him, nor do I know his real name, but what I do know,

344
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,940
is that four years ago, he was at an orphanage called "Wammy's House" in Winchester, England.

345
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,320
"Wammy's House"?

346
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,080
That must have been set up by Watari.

347
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,460
I believe that Mello is playing a game with me... Who can defeat the last boss, "Kira", first.

348
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,280
I believe that Mello is playing a game with me... Who can defeat the last boss, "Kira", first.

349
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,690
Armo Jastin.

350
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,250
It's Armonia Jastin.

351
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,240
I went to the old man and told him I lost my notebook.

352
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,160
And when I told him what it looked like, he told me that was the notebook Ryuk dropped.

353
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,070
What should I do in this situation?

354
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,150
In that case, you'll need to get Ryuk to return it.

355
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,920
I thought as much...

356
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,900
I guess I better go then... to the human world.

357
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,110
I guess I better go then... to the human world.

358
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,330
I guess you better.

359
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,370
I guess so...

360
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,000
To be continued

361
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,420
This one page of everlasting depression;

362
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,420
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

363
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,010
hakanai senpou sono meni

364
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,010
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

365
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,280
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

366
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,280
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

367
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,860
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

368
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,860
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

369
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,510
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

370
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,510
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

371
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,360
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

372
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,360
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

374
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,800
Who would know of a path to salvation?

375
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,650
Menzai no waarudo

376
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,650
World of acquittal,

00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,480
seisai no waado

378
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,480
words of retribution!

379

Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

380
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,220
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

381
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,210
Redeem the game of law!

382
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,210
Aganau houritsu geemu

383

Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

395

relentless eraser rain.

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,910
Preview

398
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,910
Calm down and listen carefully.

399
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,500
On November 10th at 23:59, all mafia members will die.

400
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,370
On November 10th at 23:59, all mafia members will die.

401
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,810
That instant will be your best opportunity to retrieve the notebook.

402
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,010
Next Time

403
