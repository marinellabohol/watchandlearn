WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

89
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,580
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

90
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,500
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

91
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,590
WHAT'S UP PEOPLE?!

92
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,150
Given the rather "convenient" interaction between Kira and the Japanese police during this incident,

93
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,520
I can conclude that Kira and the Japanese police are working together.

94
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,820
"Working together"?!

95
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,390
And if that's true, Kira is... the second-generation L.

96
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,030
And if that's true, Kira is... the second-generation L.

97
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,910
To all of you at the Japanese Investigative Headquarters: have you ever thought, even once, that your "second-generation" L might be Kira?

98
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,680
To all of you at the Japanese Investigative Headquarters: have you ever thought, even once, that your "second-generation" L might be Kira?

99
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,370
To all of you at the Japanese Investigative Headquarters: have you ever thought, even once, that your "second-generation" L might be Kira?

100
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,420
Near... I've got no choice now but to kill you!

101
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,370
Near... I've got no choice now but to kill you!

102
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,130
This is terrible! Live on TV, Demegawa is...

103
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,300
I, Demegawa, have finally tracked down the base of an evil organization that seeks to capture our God, Kira!

104
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,380
And along with my brothers, we have them surrounded!

105
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,060
Transfer

106
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,320
Supporters of Kira!

107
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,500
Don't enter the building all at once!

108
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,000
The opposition may try and blend in with the crowd and escape!

109
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,750
Obey my orders as Kira's spokesman!

110
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,970
We must corner them, expose them to the cameras, and offer them to Kira!

111
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,270
I definitely won't overlook you!

112
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,510
Near... for now, you'd better get out of there.

113
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,610
Near... for now, you'd better get out of there.

114
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,530
You've got a lot of nerve advising me, considering you're Kira.

115
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,700
I can't believe you're still saying that!

116
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:11,480
There are other organizations out there hunting Kira, and yet this attack happens immediately after I start suspecting you.

117
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,750
The timing is far too convenient.

118
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,010
Near, you're jumping to far too many conclusions from a misunderstanding.

119
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,260
To them members present at the Investigative Headquarters, at best, Kira is in your midst...

120
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,930
Please think about it.

121
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
Light-kun is Kira... that idea is being reinforced yet again.

122
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,020
Light-kun is Kira... that idea is being reinforced yet again.

123
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,320
The previous L also suspected Light-kun...

124
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,620
First squad, break down the door and the first twenty, make your way in!

125
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,870
Second squad, hold!

126
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,040
Leave that to us! We're the first squad!

127
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,000
What the--!! We were here first!

128
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,040
Near, unless we get out of here quickly...

129
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,680
What foolish people...

130
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,390
I don't find it strange that there are people who are willing to support Kira,

131
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:16,860
but that only applies to those that genuinely want Kira to judge criminals.

132
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,180
The people besieging this place are different.

133
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,320
They are truly worthless human beings.

134
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,910
As long as they're having fun, it's all that matters... they're selfish.

135
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,690
I-I realize that, but for now, we need to...

136
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,100
I-I realize that, but for now, we need to...

137
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,960
Let's use L's inheritance and those people we employed that oppose Kira.

138
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,380
But once we use that plan...

139
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,380
Let's do it. The preparations have already been made.

140
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,960
This should be interesting.

141
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,900
M-M-Money!!

142
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,780
M-M-Money!!

143
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,900
M-M-Money!!

144
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,000
I-It's money!!

145
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,420
Money?!

146
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,760
There's so much of it!

147
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,920
Amazing...

148
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,660
I should have gone...

149
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,440
Matsuda...

150
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,050
Gee, humans really are amusing.

151
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,430
But, you can exchange that stuff for apples, so I guess I can understand.

152
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,450
Bastard! I got that first!!

153
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,930
Outta the way!

154
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,460
Shit! Near, you're planning to escape amid the confusion, aren't you?

155
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,770
But if you do, Demegawa's cameras should be able to...

156
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,200
P-Pilot! Head toward the floor where the money is coming from!

157
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,340
Damn it! Deme-chan, what the hell do you think you're doing?! You can't buy love and peace with money!

158
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,840
Damn it! Deme-chan, what the hell do you think you're doing?! You can't buy love and peace with money!

159
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,660
Damn it! Deme-chan, what the hell do you think you're doing?! You can't buy love and peace with money!

160
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,050
In Lower Manhattan, New York, a vast amount of dollars are...

161
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,880
The police squads have arrived!

162
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,380
Police squads?!

163
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,460
As expected, given the panic that's ensued here, the police squads have arrived!

164
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,800
This isn't looking good...

165
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,470
Let's do this.

166
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,310
At this precise moment, we're safe even if we walk right out the front door.

167
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,190
I guess in this kind of situation, the police had no choice but to act.

168
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,360
Shit! So this is how they're intending to counter it.

169
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,570
They'll emerge, disguised as part of the police squad.

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,070
Telling Aizawa and the others to keep a close eye on the police is as good as telling them that I'm Kira.

171
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,700
There are police exiting the building!

172
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,910
Where is he?

173
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,000
He's got to be among them...

174
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,330
Where?!

175
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,480
Damn it...

176
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,080
I wonder just how much money was involved...

177
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,580
Matsuda...

178
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,120
Ten million dollars maybe?

179
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,590
How many apples is that?

180
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,970
Near!

181
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,640
Near?!

182
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,600
This is Near.

183
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,780
We've completed installation of communication circuits, so we thought we'd better get in touch.

184
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,640
Near, you're safe?

185
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,580
To all at the Investigative Headquarters, I believe it won't be long before you each come to a definite decision regarding Kira.

186
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,780
To all at the Investigative Headquarters, I believe it won't be long before you each come to a definite decision regarding Kira.

187
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:03,510
The timing of this attack is as good as saying that Kira is among you.

188
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,210
And if none of you suspect the second-generation L, then you're all worse than nursery school kids.

189
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,750
And if none of you suspect the second-generation L, then you're all worse than nursery school kids.

190
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,890
I've reinstated the phone number I gave you all a few days ago.

191
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,550
Feel free to give me a call anytime.

192
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,720
Well then, I'll be waiting.

193
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,280
What confidence... or rather, he's being pretty aggressive.

194
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,810
What confidence... or rather, he's being pretty aggressive.

195
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,270
What confidence... or rather, he's being pretty aggressive.

196
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,380
Everyone, if any of you feel like you want to help Near, please go ahead.

197
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,950
Everyone, if any of you feel like you want to help Near, please go ahead.

198
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,750
Given the current situation, I won't be offended.

199
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,320
It's my belief that, ideally, the SPK and ourselves should understand and cooperate with each other.

200
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,150
Near's the one that's holding us back here.

201
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,090
When I think about Deputy Chief Yagami, I don't want to suspect Light-kun.

202
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,190
However...

203
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,040
Dad?

204
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,960
Welcome back. You came home tonight?

205
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,220
Yeah. Why are you still up?

206
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,090
I've got exams soon.

207
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,290
I see... Just don't work yourself too hard.

208
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,620
You too, Dad, okay?

209
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,010
It won't be surprising if someone does contact Near.

210
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,530
What matters is what follows.

211
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,040
If I leave this even a single step too late, it could turn into an irrecoverable situation.

212
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,920
I've got to do it now!

213
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,800
Wow! An emergency command from Light!

214
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,660
Let's see now... number three...

215
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,180
Let's see now... number three...

216
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,050
No way...

217
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,990
Yes? Near speaking.

218
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,610
I'm with the Japanese Investigative Headquarters. I'm Aizawa.

219
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,680
The time has finally arrived... this is so that I'll be completely safe, and a normal wife to him.

220
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,930
The time has finally arrived... this is so that I'll be completely safe, and a normal wife to him.

221
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,130
This is what Light wants... for me to find true happiness in being a woman.

222
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,890
This is what Light wants... for me to find true happiness in being a woman.

223
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,900
Light, thank you...

224
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,230
I see... that's very interesting.

225
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,670
I see... that's very interesting.

226
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:22,360
So, L detained two suspects for over 50 days, and the "13 days" rule cleared them both.

227
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,970
Yes, but of course, that on its own doesn't mean that they are Kira.

228
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,510
And L had no problems releasing them?

229
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,460
No. He had Mr. Yagami, who was Chief at the time, play a trick on them.

230
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:40,160
The Chief informed them that they had been confirmed as Kira and the second Kira, and that they were being taken to an execution chamber.

231
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:47,930
Along the way, the Chief pulled a gun on the suspects and said he'd kill Kira and then himself.

232
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,190
It was believed that if they were Kira, being pushed so far, they would have killed the Chief.

233
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,570
That's how the judgment was made.

234
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,610
Kira's quite a guy...

235
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,490
Kira used their detention to prove their innocence.

236
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,610
Did the suspect offer to be detained?

237
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,790
I have to admit, Light-kun did volunteer to be detained...

238
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,210
If they did, then this settles it.

239
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,760
So, who were these two suspects?

240
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,380
I can't tell you that much.

241
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,620
Despite this, I'm still working under L, as a member of the Japanese Investigative Headquarters.

242
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,850
I understand.

243
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,390
Thank you for your valuable information.

244
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:43,150
It's the first time I've heard of people with the eyes of a Shinigami being able to see the names of others. That was helpful.

245
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,120
Well then...

246
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,360
Near, is that enough? You aren't going to question him further?

247
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,210
Near, is that enough? You aren't going to question him further?

248
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,260
At this point, it's best to leave things as they are.

249
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,550
Besides, we've learned something vital.

250
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,140
Deputy Chief Yagami and the suspect were father and child.

251
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,260
There's no other explanation for him saying "I'll kill Kira and then myself".

252
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,200
Thus, the second-generation L, and the person I believe to be Kira, is... Yagami Light.

253
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,360
Thus, the second-generation L, and the person I believe to be Kira, is... Yagami Light.

254
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,250
Thus, the second-generation L, and the person I believe to be Kira, is... Yagami Light.

255
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,650
Thus, the second-generation L, and the person I believe to be Kira, is... Yagami Light.

256
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,410
Light-kun.

257
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,920
Yes?

258
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,120
I'm going to be honest with you... I contacted Near.

259
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,060
I'm going to be honest with you... I contacted Near.

260
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,420
Don't worry about it. It's something that I encouraged myself.

261
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,450
Don't worry about it. It's something that I encouraged myself.

262
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,810
So, what did you talk about?

263
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,860
No... I won't ask you that. It might be strange for us to have a discussion about that.

264
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,570
I want to establish with absolute certainty that you're not Kira.

265
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,460
I'm sorry that you have to go through the same thing twice, but until Kira's caught, I'd like to keep a close eye on you.

266
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,580
I'm sorry that you have to go through the same thing twice, but until Kira's caught, I'd like to keep a close eye on you.

267
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,480
I'm sorry, but the same goes for Amane Misa. I'll have to check her room.

268
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,580
I'm sorry, but the same goes for Amane Misa. I'll have to check her room.

269
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,930
There's always the slight possibility that she has a notebook.

270
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,750
Wait a minute, Aizawa-san...

271
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,330
No, please go ahead.

272
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:29,090
You'll all become witnesses to the fact that I'm not communicating with Misa in secret.

273
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,240
Mogi?

274
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,610
I want this cleared up too.

275
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,520
Light-kun not being Kira would be the best outcome, but if evidence incriminating him as Kira turns up in Amane's room... then...

276
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,640
Light-kun not being Kira would be the best outcome, but if evidence incriminating him as Kira turns up in Amane's room... then...

277
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,250
Light-kun not being Kira would be the best outcome, but if evidence incriminating him as Kira turns up in Amane's room... then...

278
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,340
Aah! Mochii and Monchicchi!

279
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,320
Long time no see!

280
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,490
Since Light never seems to come home from investigating Kira, I've got nothing to do!

281
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,080
She can't possibly have the notebook on her in that outfit...

282
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,100
Misa... there's been a report that a bomb has been planted at L's house.

283
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,030
It's most likely a false alarm, but we'd like to check your apartment.

284
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,480
Huh?! Is Light okay?! I better call him!

285
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,930
You can't call him!

286
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,450
Why?!

287
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,330
Light-kun is fine. He's got some important business to attend to, so he sent us.

288
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,900
Light-kun is fine. He's got some important business to attend to, so he sent us.

289
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,400
That's right! Light loves Misa so much, he'd probably be even more worried if he heard my voice.

290
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,940
Search all you want, Aizawa... you won't find the notebook.

291
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,850
Search all you want, Aizawa... you won't find the notebook.

292
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,800
I don't want it to get awkward around here because of this...

293
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,670
This isn't a friendship club. Aizawa and Mogi can do as they please.

294
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,840
This isn't a friendship club. Aizawa and Mogi can do as they please.

295
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,640
It's time for Kira's Realm to start.

296
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,190
Kira's Realm

297
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:52,070
Greetings, supporters of Kira! I am Demegawa, Kira-sama's spokesman.

298
00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:01,970
Behold! The construction of Kira's Realm, named after this show, is progressing well thanks to all your support!

299
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,080
And once this is completed, let us all meet here, and welcome Kira-sama to his temple!

300
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,420
Wow... such bad taste...

301
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,390
Hey, is everything alright?

302
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,840
Yeah. Guess it was a fake report after all.

303
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,690
But as a precaution, one of us better stay here over the next few days.

304
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,630
Sure, thanks.

305
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,250
Mogi, you can go back to headquarters.

306
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,390
I'll stay.

307
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,190
Eh?! Mochii's not staying, but Monchicchi is?!

308
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,030
I'm not dependable enough for you?

309
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,660
That's not it... it's just that, without your old hairstyle, you just don't seem like Monchicchi. It's not cute!

310
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:43,680
Mogi!

311
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,600
Yes! I'm sorry!

312
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,250
You stay...

313
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,920
In order to complete Kira's Realm, we beseech you to donate a million yen!

314
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,530
Sounds like a scam to me.

315
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,800
Yeah, they're no different from a shady establishment.

316
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,070
It's just so unlike Kira...

317
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,890
Demegawa... he's acting on his own impulses... at this rate, people will start turning away...

318
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,690
Demegawa... he's acting on his own impulses... at this rate, people will start turning away...

319
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,180
Demegawa... he's acting on his own impulses... at this rate, people will start turning away...

320
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,180
I don't need him any longer... but...

321
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,360
I don't need him any longer... but...

322
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,300
Welcome back.

323
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,760
We didn't find anything in Light-kun and Amane's apartment, but...

324
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,710
I understand. You can continue observing Misa and me until you're satisfied.

325
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,300
At this point, I'd like to introduce you to the key members of Kira's Realm, which I myself handpicked.

326
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,270
First up is...

327
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,350
Eradicate.

328
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,940
We will join Kira-sama in...

329
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Eradicate.

330
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,200
Eradicate!

331
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,980
Eradicate!!

332
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,260
H-Help me...

333
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,810
Eradicate...

334
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,950
Please wait a moment

335
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,380
W-What the hell just happened...

336
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,120
W-What the hell just happened...

337
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,470
Why is Kira after their own followers?

338
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,960
Maybe they're stopping someone that's gone too far.

339
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,580
You could be right, but this is so cruel...

340
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,600
What's going on?!

341
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,930
Neither Light-kun nor Amane Misa have had the opportunity to use the notebook.

342
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,420
Mikami... I can really use him. Selecting him was not a mistake.

343
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,040
Mikami... I can really use him. Selecting him was not a mistake.

344
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,390
Mikami... I can really use him. Selecting him was not a mistake.

345
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,110
Even without orders from me, he understands Kira's thoughts, ideals, desires, and what's no longer needed. And he acts upon it.

346
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:14,010
Even without orders from me, he understands Kira's thoughts, ideals, desires, and what's no longer needed. And he acts upon it.

347
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,480
Even without orders from me, he understands Kira's thoughts, ideals, desires, and what's no longer needed. And he acts upon it.

348
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,940
I had Misa relinquish ownership of her Death Note.

349
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,450
I had her lose all memories of the Death Note, and send it to someone else.

350
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,740
They can ask her anything, and she won't be able to answer.

351
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,540
She is nothing but a woman.

352
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:39,290
The issue now is the next owner, a man who's already appeared on TV to appeal to Kira.

353
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:46,160
Someone who genuinely worships Kira, a man who understands that just by being given the notebook, he is the chosen one.

354
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,930
Occupation

355
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,930
Prosecutor

356
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,380
I wasn't mistaken...

357
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,430
Mikami Teru... he is worthy of doing my bidding.

358
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,830
Mikami Teru... he is worthy of doing my bidding.

359
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,930
Thank you for coming, Shinigami. I can now carry out judgments reliably.

360
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,030
Thank you for coming, Shinigami. I can now carry out judgments reliably.

361
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,870
What do you think of Kira?

362
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,000
God.

363
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,960
To be continued

364
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,430
Towa ni utsu kono ichi peeji

365
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,760
This one page of everlasting depression;

366
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,350
hakanai senpou sono meni

367
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,350
a fleeting tactic in your eyes.

368
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,620
Aigan sezumo hou ni aku tsunagou rou he

369
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,620
Let's intertwine evil with law, pass no plea and go to jail.

370
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,200
Nooto ni moudoku bonnou ni osore idaku

371
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,200
Deadly poison within the Note harbors fears of carnal desires.

372
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,850
Incessant drool at false fantasies;

373
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,850
Oouso no mousou ni yodare ga taema naku

374
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,700
judgment; never-ending talk of uniting crime.

375
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,700
sabaki hanzai toukatsu to hozaku

376
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,140
Dare ga dakaisaku nodo wakaru?

377
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,140
Who would know of a path to salvation?

378
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,990
Menzai no waarudo

379
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,990
World of acquittal,

380
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,820
seisai no waado

381
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,820
words of retribution!

382
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,560
Eru netsu masani "desu paireetsu"

383
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,560
This fire I feel, I truly am a Death pirate!

384
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,550
Redeem the game of law!

385
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,550
Aganau houritsu geemu

386
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,580
Despair the Billy,

387
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,580
Zetsubou za birii

388
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,320
here are the morals!

389
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,320
iza rinri

390
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,940
Come, relentless eraser rain.

391
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,940
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

392
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,900
Zetsubou za birii

393
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,900
Despair the Billy,

394
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,610
here are the morals!

395
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,610
iza rinri

396
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,240
Come, relentless eraser rain.

397
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,240
Saa tomerarenai eraser rain

398
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,860
relentless eraser rain.

399
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,860
tomerarenai eraser rain

400
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,410
Preview

401
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,430
Right now, you're the woman that the whole world is focused on.

402
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,180
It must be destiny that we've been given another chance to meet.

403
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,420
All I ask of you first, is the chance to meet up and talk to you.

404
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,500
Someplace... just the two of us...

405
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,920
Next Time

406
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,920
Selection
